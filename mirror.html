<p>
    There is a group of unsung victims whose number is very great. They  often
    do not seek the help they need because they do not recognize that they
    suffer from a problem for which there is a solution. These are the children
    of  narcissistic parents. I know their plight from the inside since I am one
    of  them.
</p>
<p>
    A friend asked me, “What are  narcissists? Aren’t they people who think
    themselves special?” The answer to  this is yes and no. All healthy people
    regard themselves as special, unique  beings capable of achievement and
    worthy of love, and it is no coincidence that  this is exactly the way their
    parents saw them during their formative years.  People who are relatively
    free of narcissistic traits (most of us have some) do <a
    name="page11"></a>not attempt to place themselves above others. They are
    unconcerned with such comparisons. They stay in touch with their feelings
    and  try to do their personal best. Their standards are internal and
    realistic since  they have a good idea of who they are and what they can
    accomplish (such  objectivity is not insignificant). They are not free of
    idealistic wishes and  dreams.
</p>
<p>
    Narcissists are wholly  different. They unconsciously deny an unstated and
    intolerably poor self-image  through inflation. They turn themselves into
    glittering figures of immense  grandeur surrounded by psychologically
    impenetrable walls. The goal of this  self-deception is to be impervious to
    greatly feared external criticism and to  their own roiling sea of doubts.
</p>
<p>
    This figure of paradox needs  to be regarded as perfect by all. To achieve
    this, he or she constructs an  elaborate persona (a social mask which is
    presented to the world). The persona  needs an appreciative audience to
    applaud it. If enough people do so, the  narcissist is relieved that no one
    can see through his disguise. The persona is  a defensive schema to hide
    behind, like the false-front stores on a Western  movie set. When you peer
    behind the propped-up wall, you find … nothing.  Similarly, behind the
    grandiose parading, the narcissist feels empty and devoid  of value.
</p>
<p>
    Because his life is organized  to deny negative feelings about himself and
    to maintain an illusion of  superiority, the narcissist’s family is forcibly
    conscripted into supporting  roles. They have no other option if they wish
    to get along with him. His mate  must be admiring and submissive to keep the
    marriage going and his children  will automatically mold themselves into any
    image that is projected upon them.
</p>
<p>
    Here the tragedy begins. A  narcissist cannot see his children as they are
    but only as his unconscious  needs dictate. He does not question why his
    children are incredibly wonderful  (better than anyone else’s) or
    intolerably horrible (the worst in all respects)  or why his view of them
    ricochets from one extreme to another with no middle  ground. It is what
    they are.
</p>
<p>
    When he is idealizing them,  he sees their talents as mythic, an inflation
    that indicates they are being  used as an extension of his grandiose self.
    When he hates them and finds their  characteristics unacceptable, he is
    projecting hated parts of himself onto  them. Whether idealizing or
    denigrating, he is entirely unaware that what he <a name="page12"></a>sees
    is a projection and that his views are laying a horrible  burden on his
    child.
</p>
<p>
    It is uncanny to observe how  early the process of projection begins. Before
    the child is conceived, roles  are already assigned in the narcissist’s mind
    to the flesh of his flesh. The  expected characteristics are confirmed by
    subtle actions of the fetus in the  womb, and when the baby arrives the
    parent starts ratifying his projections  through his interactions with the
    child.
</p>
<p>
    For example, a narcissistic  father was able to stop experiencing feelings
    of weakness as his own by finding  them in the personality of his
    four-week-old daughter. He never questioned the  validity of his
    perceptions. Such thoughts would occasionally reappear, only to  be pushed
    aside and defended against by focusing on others’ flaws, including  those of
    his child. He buttressed his argument by judging her physical  movements
    feeble and low in energy as well. Clearly, she was “biologically  inferior.”
    The baby’s characterization stuck and her fate was sealed.
</p>
<p>
    The mother duplicated her  mate’s view, unconsciously suppressing doubts and
    contradictory perceptions.  Her thinking was influenced by the fact that her
    husband could only accept her  when she agreed with him. She was in love
    with him at the time and very much  wanted to please. It is worth noting
    that a person who marries a narcissist  often does so to augment low
    self-esteem by amalgamating his or her ego with  that of one who radiates
    greatness. They are excessively threatened by their  mate’s potential
    rejection and will readily give the required responses.
</p>
<p>
    This child grew up according  to parental blueprint. She became an overly
    compliant person, often turning to  her narcissistic father to make her
    decisions. She took up her mother’s  profession and her mother’s submissive
    role as the appropriate way to express  femaleness and to relate to men. In
    doing so, she assumed the role that her  narcissistic father could accept in
    a woman.
</p>
<p>
    One hallmark of the child of  a narcissist is that these children tend to
    take values wholesale from the  parent rather than tailor them to fit their
    own personalities. Narcissists  appreciate carbon-copy children, since any
    change or difference from their  prototype is experienced as a criticism.
</p>
<p>
    The young woman became the  “perfect” daughter, obediently expressing
    <a name="page13"></a>her parents’  nouveau riche values. She played tennis,
    took sailing lessons, spoke French,  and summered in Europe. She was not
    outstanding in any of her acquired skills,  probably because her
    participation lacked passion. Her whole self was not  involved in anything
    she did. She was upset that no great talent ever emerged  from her efforts.
    She was somewhat overweight although attractive, but rarely  dated. None of
    the young men she encountered could measure up to her dad.
</p>
<p>
    Still, she was remarkably  agreeable, always smiling and nodding,
    suspiciously free of malice. In fact,  she was rather boring. Inexplicably,
    this paragon of pleasantness came to be  troubled by mounting feelings of
    rage. She was confused. Why should she be  angry if all was so perfect in
    her world? She had never perceived anything  damaging in the pressures
    placed upon her to become a polished showpiece. Such  thoughts were taboo.
</p>
<p>
    Her rage became  uncontrollable. It took the form of world destruction fears
    in which everything  was going to be blown up in a nuclear holocaust. This
    obsession reflected a  projection of her repressed explosive feelings.
    Fortunately, these fears drove  her into therapy. Her parents found it
    upsetting to accept that she needed help  since this reflected upon their
    adequacy as parents. Their daughter had to be  on the brink of insanity
    before she or anyone else in the family could admit  that something wasn’t
    right.
</p>
<p>
    The offspring of narcissists  grow up fulfilling their assigned roles. They
    may sense that they are in a  state of falsehood, but do not know what to do
    about feelings of  nonauthenticity. They try all the harder to become what
    they are supposed to  be, as if their feelings of uneasiness come from an
    improper realization of  their role. If their parents see them as miserably
    deficient, from the shape of  their bodies to the power of their minds, that
    is what they become. If they  were portrayed to themselves as great
    muckamucks, especially if they have  innate ability to fulfill a powerful
    role, they become the movers and shakers  of society.
</p>
<p>
    At heart, children of  narcissists, raised up or cast down by the
    ever-evaluating parent, feel  themselves to be less than nothing because
    they must “be” something to earn  their parents’ love. Conditional love
    offers no support for the inner self. It  creates people who have no
    personal sense of substance or worth. Nourished on  conditional love,
    <a name="page14"></a>children of narcissists become conditional.  They find
    themselves unreal.
</p>
<p>
    The stories in this book  concern the struggles of children of narcissists
    to free themselves from the  web of their parents’ distortions. Here we see
    the psychological reefs on which  our lifeboats may be wrecked, not the
    least of which is our own unhappy  narcissism acquired through
    identification with the powerful parent.
</p>
<p>
    The people in these anecdotes  often feel hopeless and paralyzed. Sometimes
    they break through to a sense of  their true selves. Then they know freedom
    and joy. The journey is a rough one  for all who undertake it. It is also
    the only trip worth taking.
</p>
<p>
    You who recognize your story  on these pages can take hope from the
    experience of the others, that it is  possible to undo the illusions under
    which we were raised. Let us all work to  rid ourselves of falsely imposed
    images in order to find our true identities.

        ARCISSISM
    </a>
</h1>
<p>
    It has been said that narcissism is a common condition of modern  society,
    that in the past there were narcissists but never in such profusion.  Louis
    XIV, when he uttered his famous comment, “L’état,  c’est moi” (I am the
    state) was expressing the quintessential  narcissistic viewpoint of
    monomaniacal self-centeredness. The French Revolution  was set off by his
    feelings of narcissistic entitlement. Louis’s ego was so  inflated that he
    felt it represented the needs of all France. If Louis ate,  France should
    feel satisfied. Marie Antoinette offered her own narcissistic  reaction to
    the starving masses begging for bread when she uttered her  insouciant cry,
    “Let them eat cake.” Since her belly was filled, their request  for mere
    subsistence <a name="page17"></a>seemed ridiculous. These two comments  are
    like bookends of similar design. They imply, “My needs are all; nothing and
    no one else counts.”
</p>
<p>
    A narcissist is interested  only in what reflects on her. All she does or
    experiences is seen as a  reflection of self. The name of this psychological
    aberration is derived from  the ancient Greek myth of Narcissus, a beautiful
    young man beloved of the  nymphs. The nymph Echo fell in love with
    Narcissus’s beauty but he paid no  attention to her increasingly mournful
    cries. To the gods looking down upon the  play of men, unrequited love was a
    crime. They punished Narcissus in  appropriate symbolic form by causing him
    to fall in love with his own  reflection, ever reaching out to embrace an
    illusion.
</p>
<p>
    Each time Narcissus reached  for his adored image mirrored in a pool of
    still water, it would dissolve into  numberless ripples. The narcissist, who
    is constantly trying to repair her  injured self-esteem by adorning and
    admiring her gilded self, is also haunted  by the terror of psychological
    fragmentation should she become aware that this  self is not all she claims
    it to be.
</p>
<p>
    The narcissistic character  disorder is described in the DSM-III (The
    Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) as having the
    following  characteristics: an inflated sense of self-importance; fantasies
    of unlimited  success, fame, power, beauty, and perfect love (uncritical
    adoration);  exhibitionism (a need to be looked at and admired); a tendency
    to feel rage  with little objective cause; a readiness to treat people with
    cool indifference  as punishment for hurtful treatment or as an indication
    of the fact they have  no current use for the person; a tendency toward
    severe feelings of  inferiority, shame, and emptiness; a sense of
    entitlement accompanied by the  tendency to exploit; a tendency to
    overidealize or devalue people based largely  on a narrow focus; an
    inability to empathize.
</p>
<p>
    This list is extensive but  not all-inclusive. We are said to live in the
    age of narcissism. Few of us are  entirely free of its traits. It is in our
    label, “the Me Generation,” and shows  up in popular expressions such as
    “What’s in it for me?” and “taking care of  number one.” Those who are
    philosophically inclined might ask which comes  first, the narcissism of the
    individual or that of the society in which he is  formed. There probably is
    a point at which the ills and emphases of a society  and the
    <a name="page18"></a>neuroses of individuals living within it feed into a
    common stream.
</p>
<p>
    If society worships such  external things as how you appear to others, your
    status, power, and money, a  person may acquire the belief that what she
    keeps inside, her emotions and the  deeds that only she knows about, do not
    count. Yet the only real and lasting  sense of self-worth that a person can
    have is the feeling of and for her  essential self, the sense of being real,
    of doing what possibly she alone  thinks appropriate. Having an appreciation
    of the subjective intangible is what  we mean when we say that someone has
    “character,” a rare trait today.
</p>
<p>
    Applying the values of an  externalized society to one’s self causes
    narcissistic wounding. We use the  word narcissistic to show that it is
    self-love that is harmed. When self-love depends  on externals, on others’
    opinions of what you are and do, the self is betrayed.  A woman who
    possesses great natural beauty was described by her boastful mother  in
    front of company as “beautiful as a movie star.” When she heard these words,
    the daughter cringed in shame, feeling herself to be worthless because she
    was  only valued for her surface.
</p>
<p>
    A healthy self has nothing to  do with stardom. Psychological health comes
    from acceptance starting in early  infancy of all that you are, good and
    bad, dirty and clean, naughty and nice,  smart and stupid. In the adult,
    health is manifested by an accord between  ideals and actions, by the
    ability to appreciate yourself for what you attempt  to do as well as for
    what succeeds. It means recognizing that although you are  not perfect you
    are still worthy of love.
</p>
<p>
    In high school, coaches  attempt to strengthen character by telling their
    charges to do their best and  to ignore whether the outcome is win or lose.
    Our externalized society is so  addicted to winning that such advice is but
    a weak antidote to the pressure  placed on youngsters by hysterical parents,
    idealizing students, and the school  board, all of whose egos need a win to
    contradict a basically shaky self-image.
</p>
<p>
    To grow up to be a whole  person, infants, toddlers, and children in their
    formative stages need the  experience of genuine acceptance; they have to
    know that they are truly seen  and yet are perfect and lovable in their
    parents’ eyes; they need to stumble  and sometimes fall and to be greeted by
    a father’s or mother’s commiserating  smile. Through parental acceptance,
    children learn that their “is-ness,” their <a name="page19"></a>essential
    selves, merit love. Self-love is learned through  identification. Positive
    self-regard is the opposite of what the narcissist  knows. He is “in love”
    with himself precisely because he cannot love himself.
</p>
<p>
    As a child, the  narcissist-to-be found his essential self rejected by his
    narcissistic parent.  The wounds of the parent are a template for the
    wounding of the child. Each  narcissistic parent in each generation repeats
    the crime that was perpetrated  against him. The crime is non-acceptance.
    The narcissist is more demanding and  deforming of the child he identifies
    with more strongly, although all his  children are pulled into his web of
    subjectivity. How can he accept offspring  who are the product of his own
    unconsciously despised self? His attitude is a  variant of the Groucho Marx
    Syndrome, “I would not join any club that would  have me as its member,”
    here transposed into “I would not love any child that  would have me as its
    parent.” The child has rejection as its birthright.
</p>
<p>
    The child who will eventually  turn into a full-scale narcissist most often
    had a narcissistic mother. The  reason why the maternal narcissist is more
    often likely to turn her child into  a fellow narcissist is because the
    mother most often provides the predominant  care that defines the baby’s
    early world. If the father is narcissistic and the  mother is not, the
    father’s traumatic impact is attenuated at the time when the  child is
    establishing a sense of self.
</p>
<p>
    The narcissist-to-be turns  away from a world he perceives as devoid of
    nurturance and love (since a  mother’s care gives the child its first
    version of the world). He withdraws  into grandiose fantasies to shield
    himself from profound feelings of  unworthiness caused by the fact that his
    mother does not really love him.  Grandiosity permits him to believe that he
    is complete and perfect unto  himself, thus shielding him from his secret
    sense that he is a ravening beast,  ready to murder others in order to eat
    and survive. The food of this beast is  admiration.
</p>
<p>
    The narcissistic mother,  caretaker of the child’s earliest years, is
    grandiose, chronically cold but  overprotective. She invades her child’s
    autonomy and manipulates him to conform  to her wishes. She rejects all
    about him that she finds objectionable, putting  him in the anxiety-ridden
    position of losing her affection if he expresses  dissatisfaction. She
    responds to his baby rages and fussing with anxiety,  anger, or withdrawal.
    He becomes unable to cope with the ugly feelings that <a
    name="page20"></a>threaten to erupt and destroy the bond between him and his
    mother, the bond he depends on for survival.
</p>
<p>
    His mother’s grandiosity  models a way out of his dilemma. She places him on
    a common throne, sharing the  rarefied air of her greatness. By
    appropriating and embellishing the aura of  specialness in which she has
    enveloped him he can create a grandiose fantasy  about himself to escape to.
    This fantasy eventually crystallizes into a psychic  structure we call the
    grandiose self. A new narcissist is born.
</p>
<p>
    For all his air of  self-sufficiency, the narcissist is full of
    interpersonal needs. He is more  needy than most people who feel they have
    something good inside of them. If he  is to survive, he must find a way to
    get his needs met without acknowledging  the independent existence of the
    person off whom he wants to feed. To admit  that a person is necessary to
    him gets him in touch with feelings of  deficiency, which plummet him into
    intolerable emptiness, jealousy, and rage.  To avoid this experience, he
    inhabits a one-person world. Either he exists and  other people are
    extinguished or vice versa. In his mind, he is center stage  and other
    people are mere shadows beyond the proscenium. This solution creates  a new
    conundrum: “How can I get fed without acknowledging the feeder?” The
    solution is to dissect people and to turn them partially into objects, to
    make  them inanimate. A person comes to represent a need-fulfilling function
    or an  organ like a breast, vagina, or penis. There is no overall person to
    consider.
</p>
<p>
    It is like living life in an  automat in which various emotional foods are
    displayed behind little glass  windows, with one crucial difference. In this
    automat the customer does not  have to pay. He is entitled to eat. He
    remains aloof from people in his automat  world. Since he is not psychotic
    and totally out of touch with reality, he is  occasionally forced to
    recognize the presence of a benefactor. The emotional  incursion of such an
    idea is warded off by demeaning the gift or the person who  has given it. If
    a gift is unworthy he doesn’t have to feel gratitude. Not to  say that he
    does not at times proffer thanks. A narcissist can be quite  charming when
    he wishes to impress, but his words are not deeply felt.
</p>
<p>
    He usually does not see the  need to go to such lengths with his family.
    They belong to him and are supposed  to cater to his needs. His children are
    particularly crushed by his lack of  recognition for their
    <a name="page21">
    </a>
    attempts at pleasing him since he is  the main figure in their world. Adding
    insult to injury, they can always count  on his criticism when what is
    offered falls below his standards.
</p>
<p>
    Despite his bubble of  grandiosity, the narcissist is remarkably
    thin-skinned, forever taking offense  and feeling mistreated, especially
    when people appear to have eliminated the  extras in their response to him.
    Less than special immediately implies that  someone may be thinking the
    emperor is naked, precisely what he fears. He is  enraged whenever the
    aching corns of his insecurities are stepped on.
</p>
<p>
    He is wounded when the child  he deems special fails to live up to
    expectations, reacting with a rage one  might have for a limb that has
    failed to provide support. His children and his  mate learn how to soothe
    him by propping up his grandiosity, and the special  child learns not to let
    him down.
</p>
<p>
    A narcissist tends to have  transient social relationships since few wish to
    abide by her rules. She has  quick enthusiasms, business associates but few
    friends. Her closest are other  narcissists who keep a comfortable distance
    while exchanging gestures of mutual  admiration. Neither makes emotional
    demands on the other.
</p>
<p>
    In a mate, if she does not  choose a fellow narcissist, she will cohabit
    with a person who feels inadequate  and who needs to hide in a relationship.
    This suits her well since she doesn’t  want to recognize the existence of
    another being. Often, her mate is the child  of a narcissist, already
    indoctrinated to regard exploitation and disregard as  love. Others lured by
    the narcissistic aura are those in whom healthy childhood  exhibitionism has
    been repressed. The period of healthy exhibitionism finds the  little boy
    showing off his muscles to Mom, who is supposed to be properly  impressed,
    and finds the little girl flouncing her new dress before Dad to court  his
    admiration. If the parent puts the child to shame for showing off, the need
    for attention gets repressed into the unconscious. Repression means that the
    need is not satisfied and continues to press for expression in the adult
    without her being aware of it. The repressed adult may select an
    exhibitionistic mate to achieve vicarious satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
    It should be understood that  the narcissistic personality represents a
    serious malfunction, something that  might be labeled an illness under the
    medical model. Since the medical model  does not really describe
    <a name="page22"></a>human personality, a better measure  of narcissistic
    tendencies might be the degree to which the individual is able  to be truly
    productive and loving. A narcissist may be productive  professionally but
    often is held back by his or her fear of being less than  perfect. Such a
    concern can truncate creativity and certainly undermine  relationships.
</p>
<p>
    The grandiose narcissist in  her automat world may not feel the emptiness of
    her life, although her  narcissistic traits cause suffering in all those
    with whom she has intimate  contact. She only comes to recognize that
    something is wrong (not necessarily  with herself) when the environment no
    longer supports her grand illusions and  she fails to live up to
    expectations of greatness. At this time she may become  depressed and seek
    psychotherapy to relieve the pain.
</p>
<p>
    The narcissist who hopes to  change through analytic psychotherapy will find
    that treatment is not easy. The  process must be arduous because it requires
    that she admit to human failings;  that she recognize the need for other
    people, who have the choice to give or not  to give (you cannot commandeer
    love). It means once more experiencing the  feelings of being a helpless and
    manipulated child who sustained considerable  damage at the hands of
    unloving parents. She will have to see the emptiness of  a life compulsively
    controlled by the need for admiration and ostentatious  achievement. The
    outcome of her struggle to uncover an authentic self will be  the ability to
    lead an ordinary life, one with real joys and sorrows, not the  fictitious
    pleasures of a mirrored image.

        ARCISSIST?
    </a>
</h1>
<p>
    Not all children of narcissists are identical but most share from a pool  of
    common traits. The extent to which they manifest problems specific to having
    a narcissistic parent depends upon the degree of severity of the parent’s
    narcissism and the presence or absence of ameliorating influences in the
    child’s life. These would include loving grandparents who are frequently
    around, interested teachers or other adults who can understand the child’s
    plight.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, one reason a  narcissistic home can be so destructive is that
    narcissists tend to be very  insular, having only a few close friends who
    are also narcissists, equally  insensitive to the needs and feelings of
    children. Others drawn to a narcissist  are themselves children
    <a name="page25"></a>of narcissists, too mesmerized by  the replay of their
    early childhood relationship to take an autonomous position  with regard to
    her children.
</p>
<p>
    Nor would she allow it. The  narcissist rules the emotional atmosphere of
    her home. She establishes an  airtight reality from which her children have
    little chance of escaping. Those  children whose parents separate can fare
    better if they live with the  nonnarcissistic or less narcissistic parent.
    This often does happen, as the  narcissist rarely wants the nuts-and-bolts
    responsibility of rearing her  children.
</p>
<p>
    She wants to be there on  special occasions when she can make a showy
    gesture. She will bring a present,  rent a sailboat, tell remarkable stories
    about her accomplishments and turn  herself into a heroine. Against this
    display, the daily ministrations of the  other parent fade into obscurity.
    Often, it is only as an adult, or when the grown  child becomes a parent
    himself, that the contribution and loving spirit of the  nonnarcissistic
    parent is recognized.
</p>
<p>
    A child living in a home  separate from the narcissistic parent is only
    occasionally bathed in the icy  sea of his or her parent’s peculiar world
    view. Even so, the narcissistic  parent, who is loved, needed, and
    identified with by her child, must have a  profound effect.
</p>
<p>
    The peculiar view espoused by  the narcissistic parent is that her child as
    an independent being does not  count. Here are two examples of how
    narcissistic parents could not relate to  the real needs of their children.
</p>
<p>
    A young woman just out of  college, living on an extremely limited budget,
    asked her socialite mother for  a vacuum cleaner for her birthday. Her
    mother agreed. When the date arrived,  her daughter received an expensive
    gift certificate to a fancy hair salon for  “the works.” Wild with
    frustration (and able to express her feelings after  several years of
    therapy), she asked why she hadn’t been given the gift that  was promised.
    Her mother answered in the aggrieved tone of one who has been  unfairly
    attacked. “But that’s what I thought you  needed, dear.” It was impossible
    for the mother to understand why her gift was  not altogether loving. The
    mother had given her daughter the gift that she  herself would have wanted.
</p>
<p>
    In the second example, a  narcissistic mother again pleased only herself,
    being unable to appreciate the  age-appropriate interests of her
    <a name="page26"></a>children. She took her two  youngsters to Paris, where
    she cooped them up all day in a hotel room while she  went on a buying spree
    in the fabric houses. She returned in the late  afternoon, to find two bored
    and angry children who demanded gifts for having  been good. She felt
    unjustly attacked by the “little ingrates.” Had she not brought  them to
    this wonderful city of charm and culture which she had been out  enjoying
    all day? They should have been able to appreciate it through her own
    experience, apparently through osmosis.
</p>
<p>
    Osmotic expectations are  extremely common in narcissists since they do not
    recognize the psychological  boundaries between themselves and their
    children. The children should be as  happy as they or, on other occasions,
    as miserable. If the child is happy when  the parent is sad, it is taken as
    a sign of disloyalty and insensitivity.
</p>
<p>
    The mother on her buying  spree felt that her children should have been
    overjoyed knowing that their  backsides would soon rest on wonderful
    Parisian upholstery fabric. How could  they be so unappreciative of all the
    efforts she had made on their behalf!
</p>
<p>
    The child of a narcissist is  never seen as she truly is. Even before birth,
    the parent has attributed  characteristics to the child which jibe with the
    fulminating needs of his  unconscious. After birth, the child is maimed by
    endless attempts to improve  her. She is found intrinsically unlovable and
    defective because she is born of  a parent who feels horribly insufficient
    (although he can’t admit it) and who  unconsciously puts this label not on
    himself but on his child. The child can be  attacked and corrected without
    the parent recognizing that he himself is the  target.
</p>
<p>
    The pressure from a  narcissist to conform to expectations is like the water
    in which a fish swims,  so relentless and uniform that the child is hardly
    aware of it. Struggles are  infrequent while the process of shaping is going
    on. Of course, there are  moments when the child feels mentally assaulted
    and may fight or cry, but even  then she also feels bad, wrong, and
    confused. She feels what the parent  indicates she should feel, since her
    shortcomings are a shameful disappointment  to the parent. To be included
    under the parent’s umbrella of grandiosity, the  child must exhibit pure
    excellence in whatever the parent deems important.  Otherwise she is pushed
    out.
</p>
<p>
    Proper teaching involves the  concept of improving functioning,
    <a name="page27"></a>something external to the  self, not improving the
    inner person, which must be seen as intrinsically  acceptable.
    Identification of the inner child with the behavior or the product  of her
    behavior damages her self-esteem. She comes to believe that even if she
    does succeed she is merely gold over shit, the facade of beauty over true
    ugliness. The “successful” child of a narcissist feels like a fake since the
    true self is identified with failure.
</p>
<p>
    Children of narcissists  emerge from this crucible with a common and most
    serious problem. They feel  that they do not have the right to exist. Their
    selves have been twisted out of  their natural shape since any movement
    toward independence is treated as a  betrayal and something that can cause
    the parent irreparable harm.
</p>
<p>
    The narcissistic parent’s  philosophy of rationalized self-interest prevents
    the child from understanding  why he feels guilty about having autonomous
    motives. The narcissistic parent’s  principle, “You don’t count,” means the
    child’s effort to be seen as an  individual is worthy of consideration, if
    only for trying to understand that  her problems are felt by the parent to
    be an act of treason. The child’s move  toward autonomy is greeted by the
    parent’s pain, resentment, and anger, from  which the child learns that
    becoming a separate person is wrong.
</p>
<p>
    A narcissist attempts to  define his children’s reality. He tells them what
    they are feeling and  thinking, in contradiction to what they really do feel
    and think. For example,  a father responded to his child who had just
    exclaimed, “I hate Grandma” (the  narcissist’s cold and narcissistic mother)
    by saying “You don’t hate Grandma.  Only a bad child could hate such a
    wonderful Grandma. You love Grandma.” This  statement created vast conflict
    and confusion in the child’s mind. The child  was experiencing what is known
    in the vernacular as “mind fucking.” He was  being trained to distrust the
    reality of his thoughts and to allow others to  think for him.
</p>
<p>
    Because the narcissistic  parent contradicts his child’s perception of his
    own feelings and thoughts, the  child grows up confused and tries to
    establish relationships with people who  think for him as a continuation of
    his childhood experiences.
</p>
<p>
    The narcissistic press for  symbiotic unity requires that the perceptions of
    the child and parent be  identical. In the example given above, the parent
    is attempting to keep away  his own feelings of rage toward his mother.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page28"></a>Since the  child is the carrier of the narcissistic
    parent’s perceived but rejected imperfections  and grandiose fantasies, his
    self-image is  disturbingly contradictory. He is a miserable failure who
    will never accomplish  anything and must live his life in the shadows. He
    also is capable of total  perfection and glory. His contradictory views of
    himself reflect the outer  shell and the inner core of the narcissistic
    parent’s self-view.
</p>
<p>
    Whatever the parent feels is  his or her problem is transplanted into the
    child. A narcissistic woman needs  to be the most beautiful of all but fears
    that she is ugly. When this parent  thinks that she lacks any other value,
    her child will be seen as an ugly  failure and subjected to an endless
    campaign of reform to obtain some worth.
</p>
<p>
    A narcissistic man obsessed  with intelligence wants to be thought a genius,
    while secretly fearing he is an  idiot. He sees idiocy in his child and
    persecutes the child into pretending to  be a genius to cover up his idiocy.
    The entire problem has been transplanted.  Ironically, the child may be
    extremely bright but can’t fully use that intelligence  nor take credit for
    it because he believes that he is only an idiot acting like  a genius.
</p>
<p>
    A child’s sense of self-worth  is damaged by false labeling. The more
    exaggerated his personal label, the less  he feels his intrinsic worth. Like
    olives in a jar, he is summed up and his  qualities exaggerated with little
    regard for the truth. With olives, the word great is used to designate very
    small fruit. The more a  person’s worth is exaggerated the smaller he feels.
    False labeling destroys  one’s sense of worth. All is for show. The
    narcissistic parent also feels  imprisoned by the label he has placed on his
    child. He feels painted in turn by  the image he has given the child and is
    always trying to raise the image’s  assigned value.
</p>
<p>
    The child’s inner self, which  requires unconditional love, is treated as
    identical with his external behavior  and his products. The child is
    subjected to a barrage of criticism which he  eventually comes to believe.
    It isn’t that his paper  is well written—he is a genius. It isn’t that he
    didn’t understand a certain theorem in geometry—he is  an idiot. The
    narcissistic parent frames his comments in such a way that the  child’s
    inner self is implicated. As a result, the child cannot be objective  about
    what he does and cannot utilize criticism effectively. It hurts too much  to
    take it in.
</p>
<p>
    Consequently, he often has  serious problems with performance. There are
    many ways of hiding. Some choose  inarticulateness. Their
    <a name="page29">
    </a>
    thinking cannot be evaluated through  the murk. Others cultivate the “fudge
    factor,” a messy way of writing so that  the teacher cannot read responses.
    The child can later argue that he meant  something else. As an adult, he may
    act superior and throw out esoteric  references as a smoke screen, counting
    on the fact that people tend to revere  as superior that which they cannot
    understand.
</p>
<p>
    Others fearing to try their  wings are content to show early promise and to
    live with the belief that they  could be great (and win their parents’ love)
    if they ever applied themselves,  which they dare not do. They might have a
    great natural tennis swing but they  will never practice. The fantasy of
    approval for what they might do is  preferable to the reality of possible
    rejection for what they can do.
</p>
<p>
    The child who is continually  warned about a dire end is being impregnated
    with the narcissistic parent’s  warded-off impulses and almost inevitably
    will eat of the forbidden fruit. A  parent who repeatedly predicted that his
    daughter would “end up in the gutter”  for being cute and sexy, by his
    verbalized lack of faith in her common sense  put pressure on her to conform
    to his expectations by harming herself. Her  promiscuity caused him pain and
    pleasure, which upset and gratified his  daughter as well. She was unaware
    that her sexual acting out represented loving  submission to his wishes as
    evinced by his prediction.
</p>
<p>
    Many children of narcissists  turn out rather paranoid. They develop
    hair-trigger sensitivity to anything  that might be perceived as an attack,
    whenever someone commits an error,  omission, or blunder that affects them.
    They are affected when they need not be,  believing that people are
    deliberately out to hurt them. Life can be quite  unbearable, as they always
    find themselves the targets of other people’s bad  moments. Repeatedly
    attacked by the narcissistic parent, they have come to  believe that they
    were to blame for his or her moods. The experience of being a  target is
    later extended and generalized to the responses of spouses, friends,
    children, rude cab drivers, people who squeeze them out of seats on subways,
    and the drunks who call out dirty names as they walk by.
</p>
<p>
    Having learned to accept  without question the opinions of the narcissistic
    parent, the child often  transfers this onto the world in the form of a
    pervasive or  specific-to-certain-situations gullibility. She can be
    manipulated by someone  who speaks with authority even if the
    <a name="page30"></a>supporting evidence is  lacking. She may fall prey to
    the seductive power of cults, wherever love is  promised for surrender.
</p>
<p>
    Her choice of friends will  tend toward the narcissistic, people who demand
    uncritical acceptance. She assumes  her familiar role at their feet, the one
    who listens without being listened to;  the one who laughs but doesn’t get
    to tell a joke; the one who calls but never  is called. She arranges her
    life around their schedules. Friendships are  frustrating and unfulfilling,
    not unlike the relationship with her narcissistic  parent, but she does not
    know any other way. She is in the grip of a compulsion  psychologists call
    transference, still trying to win the narcissist’s love.
</p>
<p>
    She does not know how to  protect her interests since she was called selfish
    by her parents if ever she  put her needs ahead of theirs. Loving meant
    total selflessness, giving the  loved one whatever he or she wanted without
    resentment, competitiveness, or  jealousy, even if giving harmed the giver.
    She was to make the other person  happy. Children of narcissists can be a
    remarkably unselfish breed.
</p>
<p>
    All children need love to  survive. If there is no real affection, the child
    will interpret what attention  the parent does offer as love. If all the
    child receives is criticism, then  criticism is interpreted as love and the
    behavior the parent criticized will be  repeated. If the child was only
    attended to for being slow, sloppy, lazy,  careless, etc., all
    passive-aggressive traits, then these will be retained into  adulthood. That
    is how maladaptive behavior can become ingrained and cause all  kinds of
    difficulty in later life.
</p>
<p>
    Since children of narcissists  feel so bad about themselves, they often
    develop characteristics of the skunk,  objectionable behaviors that drive
    people away. By being offensive, they avoid  the pain of getting close.
</p>
<p>
    As painful as early rejection  and loneliness can be, the skunk person
    prefers to control the rejection. To  bring this about, he becomes such
    things as an obnoxious interrupter, a  borrower who forgets to repay,
    sloppy, unkempt, or smelly. He commits a  thousand offenses and by doing so
    and getting rejected for these, preserves the  hope that his real self might
    be loved if ever he eliminated the provocation.  He defers seeking love
    until the future.
</p>
<p>
    Bombarded by evaluations and  labels that are not appropriate to him, the
    child of a narcissist does not know  what is real and what is not.
    <a name="page31"></a>He does not know who he is and  is prohibited from
    experimenting through trial and error to find out. The child  who was
    constantly told “You’re no good,” ends up feeling just that. He is what
    they say—bad, ugly, stupid, and an embarrassment to others. The narcissistic
    parent who so often suffered from shame for personal shortcomings in the
    eyes  of his scornful parents looks at his own child with disgust and
    subjects him to  the scorn he once knew. He masters the trauma of his own
    early experience by  taking the active role and doing it to another as
    helpless as he once was.
</p>
<p>
    The child is raised to  mockery, nasty laughter, a finger pointed in
    accusation, expressions of disgust  and rejection. The outcome of so much
    shaming is that the child shrinks away  from contact. He seeks invisibility
    to feel safe. Grown up, such a person will  live behind and through people
    but never out front for himself. The exposure of  his inner being is too
    threatening.
</p>
<p>
    He grows up feeling  unlovable, since he has been taught that not having
    been loved is his fault. At  best, his acceptance was conditional. A
    straight-? student whose grades are  boasted about at a party by his
    narcissistic mother feels like a gilded bird in  a gilded cage. It is not he
    who is appreciated.
</p>
<p>
    The narcissistic parent lives  on within the mind of the adult, even in the
    absence of the real parent. This  inner parent is known as an introject. It
    keeps reinforcing childhood roles and  behaviors acquired for survival. The
    introject still threatens to withhold love  if the child departs from its
    program. There is no place to run to, no  geographical hiding place to get
    away from this harsh inner voice. The child of  a narcissist grown has the
    job of rooting out the influence of the inner parent  by careful examination
    and analysis.
</p>
<p>
    A final and tragic irony is  that the child of a narcissist may himself have
    acquired many narcissistic  traits, up to and including being a full-blooded
    narcissist. Some common  features might include: self-centeredness, the
    compulsive need to be right and  to have other people submit to his views,
    an inability to take criticism, the  desire for perfection in self or in
    others he is close to, hypersensitivity  combined with the continuous
    feeling of being mistreated, an exaggerated need  for acclaim and support,
    and an even more desperate need for reassurance that  he is loved.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page32"></a>In a home  where the narcissistic parent was sadistic
    and his spouse or child the victim,  the child of a narcissist may emulate
    the sadistic role since this is what was  perceived as powerful. Children do
    not know that there are possibilities other  than those demonstrated by Mom
    and Dad and so sometimes select the role that  appears to be less hopeless.
    The adult child may victimize his spouse,  children, friends, and employees.
    He may even victimize himself, attacking his  own weaknesses with the
    hateful savagery of the internalized narcissistic  parent.
</p>
<p>
    It is extremely painful for  the child of a narcissist to discover that he
    has become what he hates, that he  has incorporated from his narcissistic
    parent the very traits that hurt him the  most. We do not like to see such
    things in ourselves. Sometimes, the child of a  narcissist develops a blind
    spot about his behavior, not unlike the parent who  also cannot see the
    truth. Nevertheless, if the child of a narcissist wishes to  achieve
    autonomy and self-respect, such traits must be greatly reduced and
    interpersonal sensitivity developed.
</p>
<p>
    In the stories that follow,  we shall see how various children of
    narcissists have struggled with these  issues.

        HINKING
    </a>
</h1>
<p>
    The power of the narcissist’s influence permeates everything with which  the
    child has contact. It becomes automatic for the child to conform to the
    parent’s viewpoint in order to avoid disapproval. A narcissist disagreed
    with  tends to either attack or withdraw. Either response would threaten a
    child. The  habit of agreeing with the parent becomes ingrained. Even a
    grown child with  some intellectual grasp of the parent’s dictatorial and
    twisted approach can  still find herself abandoning her own perceptions and
    goals and joining the  parent. This collusion is a kind of emotional
    flashback brought on by parental  pressure.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page35"></a>The  childhood habit of conformity has been
    reactivated. Once the child has shifted  from her own point of view to that
    of the parent, she may feel quite out of  touch with her self without
    understanding why. Having abandoned her own  position, she finds herself in
    a no-man’s-land. Her mental paralysis is seized  upon by the parent as an
    opportunity to extend his control. The parent calls  the shots and the adult
    child goes along in confused submission, like a  prisoner of war who has
    been partially brainwashed. She gives the desired  responses as long as she
    is prompted by her jailer.
</p>
<p>
    For those adult children who  have developed a fairly autonomous self,
    submission occurs mainly in the  presence of the narcissistic parent. For
    those who have not developed  sufficient autonomy, this submissive behavior
    will go on throughout life, in  response to both the negative inner parent
    and the pressures of the real  parent.
</p>
<p>
    The following story is an  example of a short-lived regression to the
    experience of confused submission.
</p>
<p>
    This piece was written with my father in mind. I  imagine him looking over
    my shoulder saying, “What the hell are you doing? You  know you can’t
    write.”
</p>
<p>
    The story given below is my  own, that of a person who has been working on
    herself for a long time and is  reasonably aware of her parent’s
    difficulties. It shows how I succumbed to the  narcissist’s pressure,
    although I recovered soon afterward and gained insight  into what had
    happened.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine being raised in a  room in which all the walls are distorted.
    Instead of being rectangular they  are trapezoidal, and they continually
    change their shapes ever so slightly. The  only window is a narrow slit set
    high up and containing distorting glass.  Whatever can be seen through this
    glass appears hazy and indistinct. This is  what happens to your perception
    of reality when you live with a narcissistic  parent. Not only do
    narcissists see things idiosyncratically, at deviance from  reality, which
    is common in all disturbed people, but they insist that you see
    <a name="page36"></a>things this way too. They insist because every
    difference in  your perception is experienced as an attack upon themselves.
    They methodically  wipe out their children’s attempts to develop their own
    perceptions.
</p>
<p>
    The following is an example  of what happens when I regress into allowing
    myself to be manipulated by my  father. He and his wife were in Florida for
    the winter months. In his last  phone call to me, he said that my
    eighty-eight-year-old Aunt Sara, who lives in  an old-age home, was failing.
    He said that she was “giving up” and no longer  cared to live in a body that
    refused to obey her, that she had sunk into  herself and would not respond
    to speech or touch. My father said that when the  will to live is abandoned,
    death often follows. He said that I “would of course  want to see [my] aunt
    while she is still alive.” I agreed to come as soon as  possible.
</p>
<p>
    Aunt had been struggling with  progressive Parkinson’s disease for the last
    few years. Now she was unable to  speak except for occasional bursts of
    sound when she was excited. She was  confined to a wheelchair, strapped in
    against her will. Aunt Sara had always  been a cantankerous, rebellious sort
    and so had fought the necessity of  learning to use a walker properly,
    picking it up with two hands, pushing it  ahead of her, and advancing step
    by step. Parkinson’s had made her unsteady on  her feet but she wouldn’t
    give in to it. She would stagger along wildly,  clutching the offending
    walker over her head in one hand. As one might expect,  she had several
    nasty falls, resulting in blackened eyes, black-and-blue chins,  and,
    eventually, a broken rib. The old-age home refused to take responsibility
    for her if she insisted on walking about as she did, so she was unwillingly
    strapped into a wheelchair. On one occasion, she was discovered sawing away
    at  her restraining straps with a knife she had secreted from the dining
    hall.  Unable to walk, unable to speak, unable to write, and eighty-eight
    years old,  she lived in a chronic, bottomless despair.
</p>
<p>
    Paul, her henpecked husband,  as despised as he had been needed, had died
    seven years earlier. This had made  it imperative that Sara go into a home.
    It is not unusual for all members of  one family to be narcissistic to some
    degree, and so Aunt Sara had the  narcissist’s hatred of her husband because
    she depended upon him. The efforts  of the <a name="page37"></a>slave must
    not be noticed while he gives royalty its  due. When it came to mates, Sara
    knew that she could have done better.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, she was not a  consummate narcissist like my father. She was
    capable of affection and concern,  and had demonstrated these to me, her
    niece, in the many years we had lived in  kitty-corner apartments in the
    same building. As a little girl, I and my dog  had visited Aunt and Uncle
    almost every night, while she fed me sugar cookies,  her stand against my
    tyrannical mother, who wanted to control my every move.  This made me
    uncomfortable at the times when I was feeling loyal to my mother.  I
    accompanied my aunt, who brushed my hair, gossiped with me, and was a
    fixture  in my life. No, I could not let her die unacknowledged. I made
    reservations to  go despite an extremely busy schedule that would only allow
    me to stay the  weekend.
</p>
<p>
    My father exists in a rigidly  structured routine in which the central,
    controlling factor, as one would  expect with a narcissist, is himself. He
    has embarked upon a writing program  that has consumed most of his time for
    the last ten years. His schedule is as  follows: up at eight, exercise for
    forty-five minutes, breakfast served by wife  (who has already eaten), write
    until lunch, eat lunch, write until four, stop,  go for a half-hour run,
    return and take a nap, get up and have dinner served by  wife (who has
    already eaten); watch TV and read at the same time, or lecture to  wife on
    political topics. Father’s wife goes to bed before him. He reads until  2:00
    A.M. and then goes to sleep. The next day the routine is repeated. Time
    spent trying to please wife by meeting her needs: nil. In order to be with
    him,  she must type his manuscripts, cook and serve his meals, listen to his
    political analyses, making only slight attempts to disagree with him on
    minor  points, so as to maintain the illusion of being a separate person.
    She is shy  about asking for what she wants, especially for nonsexual
    affection. He needs  to think that all he does is fine with her. Naturally
    submissive, she sometimes  complains about his selfishness, but mainly
    accepts it and goes on.
</p>
<p>
    When Father’s wife expressed  a desire for such things as pleasurable
    outings, her ideas were dismissed as  the workings of an immature mind. He
    scorned her as though she were a child,  his characteristic way of demeaning
    a woman. He was engaged in more important  things than the frivolous pursuit
    of entertainment.

    <a name="page38"></a>When his  wife railed against his rigidity and his
    unwillingness to deviate from his  program for her, he refused to speak to
    her for days. He has threatened to  leave her. One wonders how he would
    survive without her services. Typically,  she practices an unconscious
    self-censorship, choosing to view him as a  superior man above petty needs
    and vices. Her need to lose herself in a partner  fits in with his own need
    to obliterate the differences between them.
</p>
<p>
    Father’s rigid schedule is  not entirely a concomitant of his narcissism but
    also represents an attempt to  remain organized despite some brain damage
    received in a car accident many  years before. Yet his schedule is pursued
    with all the self-centeredness of a  narcissist. It follows that although he
    lives a mere twenty minutes from his  older sister languishing in a nursing
    home, he sees her but once a week for an  hour. A day-care worker was
    engaged to spend a few hours a day with Sara, to  stimulate and amuse her.
    “That is enough socialization for her,” Father had  declared. He thinks
    himself quite dedicated and loving for that once-a-week  break in his work
    schedule.
</p>
<p>
    I arrived at the airport in  Florida at 1:00 A.M. and was in my father’s
    apartment by 2:00 A.M. True to form,  he was waiting up for me. His wife
    sprang awake unnecessarily. She emerged from  the bedroom to ply me with
    food in the intrusive way she employs to show her  egoless love. All I
    wanted was to end the social chatter and go to sleep. I was  exhausted.
</p>
<p>
    Early next morning, I got out  before anyone had awakened, to run and take a
    swim. I dallied a while at the  beach. This was my time alone. When I
    returned to the apartment, my father’s  wife snapped, “Where were you? You
    were away so long.” The slave resents  another’s freedom without recognizing
    the source of her pique. “Swimming,  running, like always,” I said. It was
    my morning routine whenever I visited  them. She knew that.
</p>
<p>
    My father spoke. Now we have  the moment of the body snatchers, the moment
    when the daughter surrenders her  personhood in order to become an
    acceptable extension of the all-knowing one.  “When would you like to see
    Sara? Today or tomorrow?” I could write a scenario  around what I should
    have answered. I could have said, “I want to see her on  both days for
    several hours. You and I can do things together during the time  that’s left
    over.” If my father objected to <a name="page39"></a>driving me, I  could
    have said, “I’ll borrow your car or take a taxi or a bus. I don’t need to
    disturb your schedule.” But that’s not what happened. My father said, “Let’s
    go  today. The day is already shot as far as doing anything else. Tomorrow
    we can  take a real trip to the Everglades or the Monkey Jungle.” His wife
    looked happy  at the prospect of an outing. “We can bring your Aunt Betty.”
    “Let’s do that,”  I said.
</p>
<p>
    A fog was settling around me.  I felt as though I were observing my actions
    from a great distance, moving my  arms and legs as if drugged or as if
    moving upstream in water. My center and  purpose were dissolving. I was
    being steered by outside forces. At the back of  my mind I had the idea that
    tomorrow I would renegotiate. I put the issue off.  It was impossible to
    cope. I even began to anticipate the pleasure of a trip to  the Everglades.
    The blinders were on now and I was looking in the desired  direction. “OK.
    Let’s go see her today.” So it was decided. Everyone was happy.  Father had
    his 2:00 P.M. lunch, keeping everyone waiting as  usual, and we were off to
    the nursing home.
</p>
<p>
    We parked in the lot in front  of the handsome Spanish-style two-story
    building. The seeing-eye automatically  opened the doors to let us pass
    through into a beautiful inner garden, profuse  with flowering plants and
    huge, ancient banyan trees. Everywhere there were  people, the elderly with
    canes or wheelchairs, their attendants and guests. But  Aunt Sara was
    nowhere to be seen. We went inside and took the elevator to the  fourth
    floor. Upstairs, the wheelchairs were lined up against a divider topped
    with plants in front of the entrance to the dining room. Eating was probably
    the bright spot in their day.
</p>
<p>
    The old people all looked  terribly frail, expressionless, almost
    transparent. I didn’t know where to look  for my aunt. Was she lying
    comatose on her bed? Father was scrutinizing the  denizens in their
    wheelchairs. He approached one who was terribly out of it, her  head
    drooping on her chest. What a sorry human specimen.
</p>
<p>
    It was my aunt. I had  forgotten that my aunt had stopped dying her hair jet
    black. Aunt had always  been such a pretty woman, nothing like this huddled,
    gray rag doll. My father  put his hands on his sister’s head, gently, with a
    kind expression. The head  raised itself up and looked about. It was Sara.
    All kinds of feelings welled  up. Pity, horror, and deep love. “Sara,” I
    exclaimed, and gave her a huge hug  and a kiss. Tears filled my eyes and
    spilled down my cheeks. Sara’s eyes also  filled <a name="page40"></a>and
    she had a big smile on her face. Her eyes were  opened wide with excitement.
    We held on to each other’s hands as she was  wheeled down to the garden. Now
    Sara was rooted in time. She knew the hour and  the day. An event was
    occurring to mark it. She was relating.
</p>
<p>
    We found a nice spot under  the shade of a banyan tree and drew up wire
    garden chairs. “Which side do you  want me to sit on, Sara? Which side is
    your good ear?” Unexpectedly, Sara  spoke, sarcastic and wry as ever. “Who
    knows? You choose.” Everyone crowed with  pleasure. Sara’s speech was a
    triumph. I sat on my aunt’s left side. A few more  words, however, and my
    aunt’s vocal chords stopped responding. But the joy of  being together
    remained. We tried writing. Here, too, my aunt’s hand held out  for a few
    words, then trailed off in a spastic scrawl like the EKG markings of
    someone having a heart attack. She wrote Paul in  tiny, controlled letters,
    the name of her dead husband. Perhaps she missed him  after all. So many
    years together, he attentive, she rejecting. He had given  her his life. “I
    know, Sara,” I said. She wrote Art,  the name of her dead brother.
</p>
<p>
    Here we have another aspect  of the narcissistic relationship. When Sara was
    put into an old-age home, her  narcissist brother, my father, no longer
    accorded her the rights of someone in  full possession of her faculties, or
    perhaps his need to dominate simply  increased. One right of the elderly is
    to attend funerals; sister following  brother, friend following friend,
    until no one is left.
</p>
<p>
    My father had declared that  Sara was not to know of their brother Art’s
    death. “It would kill her,” he  said. She was treated like some kind of
    idiot, unable to figure out why her  brother had never sufficiently
    recovered from a long illness to call or write.  I had thought Aunt Sara
    should know her brother’s fate. She needed to be at the  funeral like
    everyone else, to share the healing words of the mourners: “…so  sad…I
    remember…we are left…” I had been dragged into the conspiracy against my
    will. The lies were already told before I had been consulted.
</p>
<p>
    I wrote the word gone next to Art’s name. She did not seem to understand, as
    there was no visible response. Perhaps she could not read my handwriting. By
    writing this, I had crossed my father, contradicting one of the laws of the
    narcissist, namely: “I know what’s best for you even if it includes
    depriving  you of your humanity and your human <a name="page41"></a>needs,
    including the  right to know and to make up your own mind.” Art-gone.  What
    would my father think? It had just slipped out and it was too late now to
    take it back. I hoped that Aunt Sara would know that I was trying to relate
    to  her as a full human being.
</p>
<p>
    Now Sara’s handwriting was  extinguished. But we were still together. We had
    communicated for a while and I  knew that there was still a brain and a
    heart. Sara was sitting, smiling, very  present, not the idiot child amidst
    normal children. We looked around. There  was not a person to be seen. No
    wheelchairs or walkers, no nurses or aides, no  strolling elderly people and
    their guests. Time had flown. Everyone had gone  inside to eat. It was time
    to part.
</p>
<p>
    My father dictated a final  message for me to write to my aunt, some kind of
    instruction for her to hold on  to in the intervening months—something about
    the way she should think or live.  But I wanted to leave a message of my own
    and I didn’t want my father to read  it. He had a way of demeaning the
    purity of feelings with his manipulations. He  was a spoiler of other
    people’s sentiments, probably because he was incapable  of real feeling
    himself. Perhaps he was jealous.
</p>
<p>
    I wrote, “Take good care of  yourself, Sara. I shall write to you.” I wrote,
    “I love you,” and tucked the  piece of paper into my aunt’s restraining
    belly strap. The last moments to see  the prisoner. Sara was wheeled to the
    door of the dining room. I feared that  the aide would pin the note to
    Sara’s mirror where my father would see it, and  that he would later say
    something to me about it.
</p>
<p>
    I kissed my aunt good-bye,  not wanting to let go of her small hand.
    “Good-bye, Aunt Sara,” I said,  thinking that perhaps it was for the last
    time. My father’s narcissistic glue  continued to paralyze my will. It was
    easier this way, not to have another  encounter with inevitable mortality.
    Hide your eyes. Have fun instead.
</p>
<p>
    The next day we went to the  Monkey Jungle; my father, his wife, and her
    sister, my Aunt Betty, wife of the  now dead Art. In the car, my father
    dominated the conversation with his version  of the fight they were having
    with the co-op board. His wife waffled, taking  first one side, then the
    other. She was incapable of holding a position since  it might cause someone
    to dislike her. She found this intolerable. My father  was infuriated that
    her loyalty to him was not absolute. He produced an  extremely loud,
    strident, and remarkable torrent of words. <a name="page42"></a>A  musician
    friend who played the trumpet had once said that my father had  mastered the
    art of circular breathing so that he could take in air even as he  was
    speaking. No one could interrupt him. If anyone tried, they were angrily
    told to wait until he had finished. We were his captive audience, his
    slaves. I  felt stung by the sharpness of his tongue even though I shared
    his opinion of  the board’s pusillanimous behavior. Most of me was in a
    deadened state, even as  I went through the motions of joining in the
    chatter. It was his show now.
</p>
<p>
    Monday morning I took an  extremely early cab to the airport. Something
    inside me felt wrong, but what  was it? My father kissed me a tender
    good-bye, asking me if I had had a good  time. “Of course,” I said, not
    wanting to hurt him. “I’m glad that I came.”
</p>
<p>
    At the airport, I got into a  fight with an Eastern Airlines employee. There
    was only half an hour until  flight time and there was a huge line at the
    ticket counter. “I already have my  ticket,” I said. “What gate do I go to
    for La Guardia?” The woman, walking down  the line, counting, kept her back
    turned and said nothing. “What gate do I  need?” I repeated. Still no
    response; her head remained averted. I tapped her  on the shoulder with my
    ticket holder. “Please tell me what gate to go to.” She  whirled around,
    saying, “Don’t you strike me.” “I was just trying to get your  attention,” I
    said. “The next person you do that to will strike you back. She  won’t be
    nice like me,” she said. I was boiling. “You’re not nice. In fact,  you’re
    quite rude and if you keep this up, I am going to report you.” The girl
    spat out, “Gate twenty-three.” I set off at a run, thinking that the girl
    had  been spoiling for a fight. But so was I. Why was I so angry?
</p>
<p>
    On the plane I calculated: I  had spent $290 for the ticket, $45 to put my
    car in long-term parking, $21 for  cabfare back to the airport, $12 for the
    Red Top jitney upon my arrival. That  made a total of $366. A lot of money
    to see my aunt for one hour.
</p>
<p>
    It hit me hard. I had been  entirely co-opted. The trip had been almost in
    vain. Rage and then depression  flooded me. How could I have allowed this to
    happen? Although I was angry at  him, it wasn’t even my father’s fault. He
    was just being himself, like a force  of nature. I had gone into the lion’s
    den without a whip, into the desert  without a compass. I had been
    emotionally unprepared and as a result, once the  force field had been
    turned on, I had reverted to the little girl’s posture <a name="page43"></a>
    I had always taken, the role my father imposes on all women,  that of
    thoughtless, frightened obedience. Poor Sara, with her one-hour visit.  If
    not today, then tomorrow, her chin would be back upon her chest. I could not
    afford another trip soon. This one had been spent with monkeys. Perhaps the
    next one would be too late.
</p>
<p>
    In this story, we see the  interaction between the narcissistic parent and a
    grown child, one with  considerable ego strength and awareness. Nevertheless
    this child, myself,  succumbed to her father’s egocentric philosophy and
    once more entered the  distorting trapezoidal room. I forgot how to exert my
    will, lost my intention  and purpose, and was incapable of reviewing my
    options. For a brief spell, I  entered the obedient limbo of the inauthentic
    life whose main reward is not to  be attacked or rejected by the
    narcissistic parent. Once away from him, I soon  recovered. Unfortunately,
    not soon enough to have a full visit with my aunt or  to make a proper
    farewell.
</p>
<p>
    Next time, I will go down to  see my aunt without telling my father that I
    am there. To confide such a plan  to a person who is hypersensitive but
    blind to the needs of others when he will  surely disagree causes
    unnecessary difficulties for both parties, since the  narcissist must always
    be right.

<p>
    Even a person who has worked for many years in therapy may have to  struggle
    with the invisible force that is the emanation of the negative inner  parent
    continually trying to control the adult child’s actions. The child part  of
    the adult mind refuses to surrender its wish to win the love of the
    internalized narcissistic parent. Despite abundant evidence to the contrary,
    it  continues to believe that such love is possible. It is this desire and
    belief  that keeps alive the power of the negative inner parent.
</p>
<p>
    To please this inner parent,  the adult must be what the
    <a name="page45">
    </a>
    narcissistic parent seemed to  require. An adult might suspect that she is
    falling under the power of the  negative introject any time her behavior
    seems to be veering in a direction  counter to her adult aims. It is a
    likely explanation for otherwise  inexplicable feelings of inadequacy and
    inferiority, especially when attempting  to accomplish something. The
    negative inner parent undermines adult  effectiveness in the same way the
    narcissistic parent undermined the child in  order to “accept” her.
</p>
<p>
    There is an ongoing war  between the adult finding her way in life and her
    childish part still under the  sway of the negative introject. The adult
    part can prevail if the person learns  to recognize that the messages of
    this inner parent are wrong. These messages  tell the person that she
    doesn’t have what it takes to make it in the real world.  The inner parent
    withdraws its support if the adult persists in her efforts.  This leads to
    severe anxiety, depression, and feelings of abandonment.
</p>
<p>
    If the person believes the  messages of her negative inner parent, she
    surrenders real life for the reward of  living according to childhood rules
    and the fantasized satisfaction of parental  love.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the undermining of her  ego, the child of a narcissist is easily
    discouraged by real-life difficulties.  The negative inner parent distorts
    reality to prove its point about the  person’s inadequacy and the person
    believes its message. In Anne’s story, we  see a woman struggling with the
    invisible force, the power of her negative  introject. The outcome of this
    struggle will depend upon her skill in detecting  the workings of the
    invisible force and her determination to root out its  influence. Every
    child of a narcissist must develop his or her will if he or  she is to
    recover.
</p>
<p>
    Anne and I speak about her inability to finish  the projects she has
    started. She is full of despair, aware that this problem  touches every
    aspect of her life. The symptom of incompleteness even appears in  our
    <a name="page46"></a>interview, as when she interrupts a painful recounting
    of how her mother failed to help her at a time when she was sick to admire
    my  earrings, completely forgetting what she was talking about. Her
    lighthearted  prattle and myriad time-consuming, seemingly unavoidable
    chores cover up what  is really going on. Anne is not allowed to achieve if
    her objective is of  personal benefit.
</p>
<p>
    She takes me downstairs to  see her daughter’s playroom, a huge finished
    basement looking out onto a lawn.  Every inch of the room is strewn with
    toys or some parts thereof, games,  puzzles, and objects to climb on or
    into. The chaos is striking. The whole room  looks like a Mattel toy
    showroom after a saboteur has thrown a bomb. Anne says  sadly, “I keep
    meaning to clean it up, but all I do is keep looking at it.”  Each day,
    looking at the disorganized playroom without doing anything about it
    reinforces the message she gives herself of her impotence.
</p>
<p>
    The overabundance of toys  hints at other issues. If the child is inundated
    with things, it may indicate  that Anne cannot set limits. If she cannot say
    no, she will feel angry and  frustrated at things getting out of hand. One
    can easily picture her daughter  amidst these mounds of toys, so many that
    she cannot develop an attachment to a  favorite. If one gets broken or a
    part is lost, she moves on to another,  overstimulated yet unsatisfied.
</p>
<p>
    Another reason for offering  so many toys is that such a profusion will keep
    the child from developing a  favorite and leave the mother as number one. A
    parent who so much fears the  loss of her child’s affection suffers from
    profound insecurity.
</p>
<p>
    I ask Anne about her giving.  She says that she was deprived in childhood
    and she is trying to keep her child  from knowing that terrible feeling. I
    do not ask her of what she had been  deprived. I suspect that it wasn’t just
    toys.
</p>
<p>
    She feels guilty any time she  thinks of her own needs. If she wants to go
    for a run, she will do something  for or with her child instead. She lets
    the child “consume” her and resents the  child for doing so. Her fury
    explodes into yelling. Then she becomes depressed  at being a bad mother who
    is out of control, which leads to more indulgence of  the child as
    atonement. She cannot see where and how to break the cycle.
</p>
<p>
    Anne may feel trapped in her  pattern but she is trying to change.
    <a name="page47"></a>She is in therapy. Her  healthy side looks at her sick,
    compulsive side and shakes its head in  amusement. She says that her “sick
    side” is in the grip of an “invisible  force.”
</p>
<p>
    What exactly is this  invisible force? It is the irrational influence she
    conceals with various  rationalizations as she flits from one uncompleted
    project to the next. The  invisible force is what holds her back and prompts
    the most peculiar behavior.  Take her most recent attempt at a career. She
    has been a nightclub singer, a  teacher in the public school, an athlete,
    all of which she was good at and  abandoned. Then she entered the field of
    real estate.
</p>
<p>
    She received her license and  survived the initial anxiety of learning how
    to sell property. She found that  she enjoyed selling, liked meeting new
    people, and derived a good deal of  satisfaction from showing people houses
    they liked. She had absorbed the  narcissistic viewpoint: If they like it,
    the thing I  sell, then I am OK. All was going well and monetary  success
    was on the horizon when she started sabotaging herself.
</p>
<p>
    This sabotage involved not  getting her customers to their destinations, an
    integral part of the business  of selling real estate. Suddenly, she could
    no longer read a map and began to  get lost, even on roads she knew quite
    well. Feeling more and more helpless,  she would hand the map over to the
    client to extricate them. The idea that she had  displayed incompetence made
    her believe that her customers would not trust her  judgment about the
    property she was showing. In her embarrassment she would  grow tongue-tied
    and forgetful.
</p>
<p>
    Ultimately, she grew to  believe that selling was a lost cause. It was
    difficult for her to see that it  was her unconscious that was getting her
    lost. It was her unconscious that  caused her to hand over the map in order
    to create an image of incompetence. It  was the invisible force that told
    her to quit rather than to fight it out with  herself.
</p>
<p>
    After a long period of  struggle, she became totally exhausted by the worry
    and stress of her  self-defeating game. She hated going to the office and
    had trouble getting up  in the morning. It seemed to her that there was
    something physically wrong, and  a doctor’s exam confirmed it. Stress had
    made her quite anemic. It became  necessary for her to quit the job.
</p>
<p>
    It is not surprising that  Anne was married to a man who felt
    <a name="page48"></a>insecure about his own  abilities. In order to feel
    adequate, he needed to be the main breadwinner. His  wife’s potential for
    earning could threaten him. He felt better if his wife  merely dabbled.
</p>
<p>
    One might expect the unhealed  child of a narcissist, under the compulsion
    of the invisible force, to marry  someone who would hold ideas about her
    nonfunctioning in some ways similar to  those of her parents. Since her
    husband found Anne’s potential for earning  threatening, she was convinced
    that he could not accommodate her movement  toward greater independence and
    feared that she would lose him if she  continued.
</p>
<p>
    Through the childhood  experience of her parents’ rejection, Anne had become
    well versed in the art of  submerging herself. The expected abandonment by
    critical parents and a  suppressive husband sat in the back of her mind,
    creating overwhelming anxiety.  Her thoughts were not clearly organized. She
    just knew that everything she held  most dear was in danger if she continued
    to develop her job skills. It was a  relief to fail and get it over with
    rather than to continue, all the while  expecting the earth to open and take
    away the support of her husband and the  pleasure of her family.
</p>
<p>
    Longing for parental love  creates the invisible force. Love causes us to
    learn what the parent needs from  us. It places the parental figure in our
    psyche as a governing body, setting  standards for behavior and granting
    love as a reward for doing what meets with  its approval. The need for love
    makes the child malleable clay in the parent’s  hands.
</p>
<p>
    When the parent is a  narcissist, the course is extraordinarily difficult.
    Most of the child’s  natural behaviors meet with disapproval. The child is
    always trying to please  yet never finding out what is effective and
    acceptable. The ante is always  being upped. The child becomes confused,
    angry, and depressed, alternately  trying and giving up, yet remaining in
    the parent’s sphere of influence. He  does not learn to please himself.
</p>
<p>
    Let us look at Anne’s  upbringing. She got a double dose since both parents
    were narcissists. Neither  was able to accept her as a person. Her mother
    used her as a handmaiden. Anne  was required to be charming and lighthearted
    as she attempted to meet her  mother’s needs for support and company. Anne’s
    compulsive gaiety emerges when  she speaks of her various self-destructive
    activities as if she were telling an <a name="page49"></a>amusing tale. Her
    laughter indicates that the child within  her has been obeying the
    immolative laws of the inner parent telling her to  destroy herself. If the
    inner parent is happy, she is happy.
</p>
<p>
    At times during Anne’s  childhood, her mother would attack her for no
    apparent reason. Anne remembers  one such occasion in which her mother flung
    a hairbrush at her with such force  that it left a raw gash in her head.
    Anne understood her mother’s rage as the  result of some flaw within
    herself.
</p>
<p>
    Her father also was  controlling and physically abusive. Although he did not
    admit his attraction  and never acted openly sexual toward her, he had
    strong incestual leanings. His  daughter was very attractive. Her hourglass
    figure and huge, laughing eyes had  the boys flocking around. Her father
    couldn’t stand her interest in other men.  He needed her to remain his
    exclusive possession.
</p>
<p>
    Anne’s needs did not count.  Her parents defended their fief in her by
    verbally attacking and demolishing  her interest in each young man who came
    along. Cowed by their violence and  still seeking their approval, she
    accepted that the boys were as unworthy as  her parents claimed.
</p>
<p>
    Her father was a self-made  man who needed to flaunt the brittle power of
    money. He was an accountant with  many clients in the underworld. His own
    tough, lawless attitude showed an  identification with the gangster
    mentality. The only boyfriend of whom her  father approved was also a shady
    character. He could accept someone whose  personality was like his own. If
    Anne had accepted the gangster, she would be  symbolically choosing her
    father. If she chose a different type, her father  would take it as a
    personal rejection. Despite his attempted influence, Anne  resisted and did
    not marry the gangster suitor.
</p>
<p>
    Her latent healthy side  craved a relationship with someone who would care
    for her  and not merely use her as an embellishment to his causes. She did
    meet that  someone, a fine young man who understood her entrapment between
    two  narcissistic parents. He advised her to leave them, not so much to
    please him  but so that she could “become a person.”
</p>
<p>
    The two young people shared  deep feelings. Anne did not know what to think
    of her experience. After a  lifetime of manipulation, she was confused by
    honest dealing. Her father  probably understood better <a name="page50"></a>
    than she the importance of their  union. He didn’t like it. One day, he
    called her over and told her to get rid  of the young man saying, “That one
    is evil!”
</p>
<p>
    Who could be more evil than  one who threatened his hegemony over his
    daughter? He reinforced his comments  with a hard slap in the face,
    humiliating Anne as he had always done.  Humiliation leads to the
    selflessness of surrender. Confused and numb, she said  farewell to her
    young man. She had to believe that her father was right.
</p>
<p>
    As Anne spoke to me of this  time in her life, I could sense her love for
    the young man. He was the one she  had wanted to marry. She loved him still.
    He had given her the strength that  helped carry her out of her crushing
    parental home. He had cared about her.
</p>
<p>
    Anne spoke to me out of  emotional need, as a former member of a shared
    psychotherapy group in which we  listened to one another’s problems and
    offered our solutions. She asked me the  question that haunts children of
    narcissists: “Did they want to hurt me? Did  they want to ruin my life?” And
    in this instance, “Why did they reject every  man who ever cared for me?”
    The narcissistic parent does not want to hurt his  child. He does not even
    see that there is a child to destroy since he lives his  life by looking in
    the mirror. He needs to destroy any “obstacle” in his path,  any situation
    that threatens his security. This includes the developing  autonomy that
    helps his child to grow away from him. The child is felt to be a  part of
    himself. If the child separates, he will be hurt and possibly  destroyed. So
    he holds on as long as possible by extinguishing the spark of  separateness.
</p>
<p>
    The narcissist attacks  separateness in everyone with whom he must have a
    relationship. Either they fit  into his ego-supporting mold or they are
    extruded from his life. Narcissistic  rage and aggression are based on fear.
    His entitlement to absolute control over  others must go unchallenged. The
    child’s natural growth sets off the parental  alarm signals. The child is
    blamed for his emerging individuality as if it were  a crime. He is made to
    feel that there is something wrong with such  development.
</p>
<p>
    Anne’s father frequently  called her a “nothing,” especially when he saw
    that she did not exist  exclusively for him. One time, she had injured a
    tendon while dancing at a  party. Her father paid her a condolence call in a
    rage, since her injury was  material evidence of her unfaithfulness. After
    visiting for a brief period, he  yelled, “You are <a
    name="page51"></a>nothing,” and stormed out. In gist, he was  saying, if I
    can’t have you, you don’t count.
</p>
<p>
    Anne’s mother also treated  her as a nothing. She needed her children to be
    valueless, dependent, and  helpless so that they would always be at her beck
    and call. She also needed  them to fade into the woodwork when she didn’t
    want to be bothered by them.
</p>
<p>
    One of her grown sons now  holds a job but is otherwise totally under the
    control of his wife. The other  son “faded away” into drug addiction. The
    mother is now widowed and well off.  She is unwilling to do much for Anne,
    who is treated as a traitor, probably for  the crime of moving far away. Her
    addict son has the run of her house. He has  his own key and permission to
    use her apartment whenever she is traveling.  Once, he brought a fellow
    addict and a puppy that soiled her rugs. He ransacked  his old room and
    other closets for things that he could sell and left the place  a filthy
    mess. Anne’s mother complained to her about his activities but let him  keep
    the key. He is an extension of her royal, pampered, baby self and is
    therefore allowed to eat and soil wherever he wants. She is pleasing herself
    by  indulging her son and does not realize that she is destroying him in the
    bargain.
</p>
<p>
    If Anne asks to borrow her  mother’s apartment while the mother is away so
    that she and her family can  enjoy an affordable California vacation, she is
    told, “I’ll see,” or “Do you  really need it?” Anne and her family are
    unimportant. Her request is an  inconvenience. Anne is hurt that her mother
    shows no interest in Anne’s  daughter. When her mother visits, she does not
    spend five minutes talking to  her grandchild. Anne’s raw pain over her
    mother’s behavior indicates that she  still does not accept her mother’s
    limitations. She doesn’t recognize that her  mother’s self-absorption is
    nonnegotiable. If she were to show interest in her  grandchild, it would
    only be an act.
</p>
<p>
    As we talk about these  things, Anne scratches her head in the age-old
    gesture of one trying to  understand the incomprehensible. She cannot grasp
    that her parents’ destructive  treatment has little to do with her. The trap
    of obsessive doubt ensnares many  children of narcissists, sometimes for
    life. They keep trying to understand,  trying to find the key that will
    release the as yet unseen parental love,  instead of breaking away and
    leading their own lives.
</p>
<p>
    Although the overall picture  of narcissism can be readily understood,
    <a name="page52"></a>small details of  parental behavior are inexplicable.
    There is no rational explanation for what a  completely self-centered person
    will do. What they themselves say about it  later bears no relation to the
    original motivation. They often surrender to  overpowering impulses based on
    distorted, one-sided, and limited perceptions.  The adult child of the
    narcissist must wean himself of the compulsive need to  understand the finer
    points of his parent’s behavior. He must steer himself  away from the pool
    of Narcissus before he falls in and drowns.
</p>
<p>
    Let us return to Anne and the  invisible force. She completed college and
    immigrated to Buffalo, where she met  and married her first husband. He was
    a kind-hearted tyrant who demanded that  she accede to his eccentric
    lifestyle. People imprisoned by the invisible force  are more comfortable
    with emotional prison walls than living in a free  environment in which they
    continue to feel paralyzed.
</p>
<p>
    She continued to live according  to the parental edict: “Be nothing.” She
    has many ways to be nothing. One is to  be unreliable. She cancels
    appointments at the last minute. She forgets to show  up and is always late.
    Such behavior makes the symbolic statement, “Don’t  expect anything of me. I
    don’t exist.” Her weight went up and came down, a  roller coaster of
    obesity. Fat is another way of hiding. A fat body reassures  her inner
    parents that she is a good little asexual girl not at all interested  in sex
    and boys. During adolescence she became addicted to diet pills,  believing
    herself too weak to control herself without them. Pills became her  support
    for all kinds of social interactions. Her ego sagged as she  increasingly
    attributed her accomplishments to the power of the pills.
</p>
<p>
    The child of a narcissist is  not supposed to see her own power, which would
    threaten the inner parent.  Recently, Anne had to take thirty-seven college
    credits in an extremely short  period. She gave herself no praise for
    getting through. Credit to the self  interferes with obedience to the law:
    Be nothing.
</p>
<p>
    She has assimilated some of  the narcissistic ideas of her parents, for
    example, that only perfection is  acceptable. Accordingly, her fear of
    criticism keeps her from trying out for  the acting career she has always
    wanted. Perfectionists are afraid of being  seen and judged. She finds it
    difficult to lose weight and to exercise although  she loves sports.
    Narcissism demands that she remain ageless and perfect. To  take care of
    <a name="page53"></a>one’s body is to note the ravages of time and  to
    resist them as best one can. If Anne remains a “fat baby,” she is ageless
    and safe. Time is the worst enemy of narcissists because it is an even
    greater  force than they are. Even they must defer to time. The narcissist
    is too weak  to admit to vulnerability.
</p>
<p>
    But Anne is getting there.  She remains in therapy and continues to struggle
    with the unconscious pressure  on her to be passive. The war is not over
    yet. There are temporary defeats but  no final surrender. She tries not to
    punish herself with depression each time  she falls. She picks herself up
    with a laugh and starts again, saying a slow  farewell to the internalized
    narcissistic parents who have coalesced into her  invisible force.

<p>
    The demon of self-hatred—its appetite is  voracious. It overwhelms and
    consumes me. Its energy explodes and I am filled  with deep rage and desire
    for annihilation.
</p>
<p>
    —John (written right before he discovered Zen)
</p>
<p>
    Because he loved his father, John fully internalized his father’s  hateful
    attitude toward him. This created a powerfully self-hating negative  inner
    parent (negative introject). A child’s need to believe that his parent
    loves him, no matter how he has been treated, caused John to read parental
    mistreatment as a kind of love. If it was harsh and hateful love, that is
    what  was merited by his unworthy self.
</p>
<p>
    John’s father had high  academic and athletic expectations but treated John
    as a shabby failure who  “didn’t have it.” John lived a life of horrible
    conflict. One part of him <a name="page55"></a>resisted his father’s
    pressure to conform to wishes that would  have obliterated him as a person.
    The other part secretly agreed with his  father’s condemnation and deferred
    to the negative inner parent, attacking  himself with a deadly hatred.
</p>
<p>
    Any time his environment  shifted so that his minimal emotional support and
    appreciation diminished  further, the negative inner parent would call for
    suicide. Suicide offered  resolution for several needs and motives. It was
    an act of spite against those  who had failed to help, mainly his father. It
    was an indirect plea for help for  one who could not find the words. In a
    negative way, suicide was a request for  love from the negative inner
    parent. If this introject would have John kill  himself, then by following
    its edicts and making the attempt, he is trying to  please that internalized
    need system. As a result the negative inner parent  should love him for
    acting like a “good boy.”
</p>
<p>
    This is one logic of the  unconscious. It shows that suicide is always a
    motivated act, but the motives  vary except in cases of severe physical
    disorder where it is only to end a life  of pain.
</p>
<p>
    John sprawls before me on his bed smoking  cigarettes and speaking of the
    past. We are old friends. I have seen him  through many stages, during which
    he often clashed with various authority  figures or threw in the towel on
    his latest endeavor or interest. He would get  fed up, bored, and start to
    bail himself out despite unmistakable signs of  success. My telling him
    about the theme of this book sent him deeper into  history. He alluded to
    his childhood as a source of black humor. His stories  offered a sarcastic
    depiction of violence and rejection, but never before had I  heard him speak
    of his suicidal past nor felt his emotion when speaking of the  almost
    grotesque mistreatment to which he was subjected.
</p>
<p>
    We are sitting in a room that  is dark and austere. Since his wife’s recent
    and abrupt departure and the  removal of her bric-a-brac, dolls, exercycle,
    and TV, it has reverted to the  monastic cell it actually is.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page56"></a>John is a  Zen priest living alone atop a Zen
    meditation center. It is as if the marriage  never happened and perhaps it
    should not have, even though the union had  several positive elements in its
    favor, such as friendship, fun, loyalty, and a  shared love for Buddhism.
    The missing element was sexual passion, the same lack  that quickly damned
    his first marriage.
</p>
<p>
    When choosing a mate, John  seems unable to seam the rational and sexual
    sides of his nature. Since only  one side is represented, sooner or later
    the unmet needs of the other begin to  build tension until there is an
    eruption that blows the whole structure. After  the marriage, which occurred
    primarily to please his second wife, she grew  fatter and fatter until he
    was totally turned off and unable to respond to her  sexually. But sex
    between them had never been very satisfying to him, and she  may have gained
    weight to protect herself against the ultimate abandonment she  expected
    from this enigmatic man. She could blame his rejection on her weight  rather
    than on some more essential flaw. John followed the script and did  develop
    an attraction to another woman in the Zen community, which came to his
    wife’s attention in the most unexpected manner. She fled.
</p>
<p>
    John has more than once  thumbed his nose at societal restraints, including
    the restraints of  conventional monogamy. He walked out of graduate school
    halfway to his master’s  degree. Once, as a kid, without asking permission,
    John, his brother, and his  sister, Delores, ate the cake they found cooling
    on a shelf in the kitchen.  Their mother had baked it to be served to her
    social group the following  Sunday. They enjoyed every bite of it. I asked
    his sister for an example of  John’s antisocietal position and she said that
    John led a hand-to-mouth  existence, never trying to secure a reasonable and
    constant salary. I remember  his cooking for a health food restaurant and
    coming to work in pants so torn  that his buttocks were half exposed. His
    sister called this “commonplace hippie”  behavior, but I remember it as
    causing a minor scene when he came out to speak  to a customer. The seeds of
    rebellion are planted deep but John does not  recognize them when they
    flower. He does not see the repetitive elements in his  life pattern.
</p>
<p>
    Childhood was spent in the  West. His family on both sides are old Western
    stock, sturdy, intelligent, and  cantankerous types who came over on the
    first waves of migration from England  when the United <a name="page57"></a>
    States was still “the colonies.” A famous  general is in the family tree.
    John is proud of his heritage.
</p>
<p>
    In the earliest memory of his  father, the man is advancing before him, a
    hazy figure whose feet make  crunching sounds on the gravel. John trails
    behind listening to his father’s  footsteps. The resounding crunches are
    very pleasing to his ears. They suggest  that his dad is big and
    substantial. John knows his father only through  indirect epiphenomena, like
    the trail of a jet in the sky after the plane has  already passed. It is
    hard to know a person who is disguising his image and on  the run. His
    father does not speak. John’s own footsteps on the gravel are  inaudible.
</p>
<p>
    His father has always been  out of reach. He doesn’t speak to any of his
    three children, two boys and a  girl. John is the youngest. Delores, the
    oldest, is away at prep school. John  is starved for knowledge of his
    father. He sneaks into his bedroom and opens  bureau drawers to smell the
    familiar odor of his clothing. He tries on his  father’s shoes and
    fantasizes about his father’s life.
</p>
<p>
    He has nicknamed his father  the Sphinx, not for wisdom but for silence.
    John’s own self-image is limited by  a shortage of paternal male qualities
    to emulate. He knows that his father is a  minister with a distaste for his
    work. His father’s mother pushed him into the  ministry so that he could
    replicate the image of her adored father. Needing  one’s children to fulfill
    personal expectations regardless of their own  interests suggests that she
    was narcissistic. Her other son also became a  minister but was better
    suited to the profession.
</p>
<p>
    John’s father suffered from a  stammer as a result of his mother’s shifting
    him from left- to right-handedness  when he was young. Although making
    righties out of lefties was not uncommon at  that time, child “improvement”
    is the hallmark of the narcissistic parent. His  stammer was suppressed by a
    special training program but would put in an  appearance under stress. This
    did not make pulpit work any easier.
</p>
<p>
    Since flying was his love,  Father moved his family to a new ministry on
    several occasions to get closer to  a flying field. He also did not hit it
    off with his congregation. When John was  about ten, his father left the
    ministry for flying. Now he no longer had to  fake his role as leader of the
    flock, to give stock sermons while  surreptitiously glancing at his watch to
    make sure that he got to the golf  links on time.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page58"></a>He loved  to teach flying, to be around it and to do
    it. After he left the ministry, he  became even less available to his family
    because he was always down at the  field. Occasionally he took John along.
    John says wistfully, “I loved flying  and wanted to be a pilot.” He needed
    to have something to share with his  father.
</p>
<p>
    John remembers an early  drawing he made of his home with a green lawn in
    front, his bike leaning up  against the house, and a small plane circling
    overhead. He says, “That was Dad,  up in the sky.” He was perhaps eight or
    nine when his father would take him to  the airport and park him in a
    “crashed out, ancient plane” on the edge of the  field. His father would
    tell him, “Try and start it up,” and leave to go up  into the sky with other
    people whom John assumed were his students. John says,  “He didn’t want any
    kids around.” John received none of the special  recognition, attention, or
    training that would usually be accorded to the instructor’s  son. He would
    play for a while in the crashed plane and then just hang out,  waiting for
    his dad, yearning to be up with that glamorous figure. He spent an
    inordinate amount of time alone. He says, “I was used to it. I could amuse
    myself.”
</p>
<p>
    While his father was still  living at home, he obviously didn’t enjoy the
    company of his children. He was  always clearing them out of any room he was
    in and sent them to bed as early as  possible. Boys were “too noisy.” They
    weren’t “peaceful.”
</p>
<p>
    John and his older brother,  Timothy, were not at all friendly with one
    another and fought all the time.  John says that “Timothy was full of anger
    and he … worked me over good.”  Fighting probably was an outlet for their
    frustration as well as having the  unconscious objective of forcing their
    father to intervene and pay them some  attention. Their father would pull on
    his belt as if to say, “OK, boys, now  you’re gonna get it.” It wasn’t much
    but it was better than nothing.
</p>
<p>
    John remembers only a single  moment of tenderness with his father.
    Significantly, it occurred after he was  beaten. He had been smoking under
    the house when spotted by a plumber, who  turned him in to his parents. John
    had been smoking cigarettes stolen from his  parents for years. It was a
    point of pride that he enjoyed inhaling while his  friends were still
    holding the smoke in their mouths.
</p>
<p>
    When John’s father heard of  his smoking, a habit that he of course shared,
    the belt came off in earnest.  There was no discussion, no
    <a name="page59">
    </a>
    concern for the inconsistency  that allowed him to punish his son for
    something he himself did. Five or six  blows were administered to John’s
    posterior. He lay weeping on his bed when he  felt his father’s hand gently
    rubbing his back, attempting to soothe him. Love,  at last. Did John form
    some association between abuse and love? He has  certainly lumbered into an
    inordinate number of mistreating relationships in  his life. His
    girlfriends, of whom I have known three, were selfish,  self-centered, and
    demanding; they also were attractive and distant. I remember  one who would
    not say hello because she was washing her hair at the kitchen  sink right in
    front of me; another would not go with John to visit his sister  because she
    didn’t like the area. For John, love and warfare are related, not
    surprising for the son of a bellicose narcissist.
</p>
<p>
    The silence of the Sphinx  extended to John’s mother. She had no inkling
    that her husband was planning to  leave them and had thrown a surprise
    birthday party for him just a few days  prior to his departure. Things had
    not been good between them for a long time.  One day soon after the party,
    her husband threw a few things, including his  presents, into a bag and
    departed for good. The only clue that ten-year-old  John had of his father’s
    approaching flight was seeing him sitting on the side  of his bed with his
    head in his hands. John knew better than to inquire about  what was
    bothering him.
</p>
<p>
    John’s father is a  narcissist. He had little interest in his wife and
    children. During World War  II, although a minister, he vanished into the
    RAF, leaving his wife to fend for  herself. He was still a minister at this
    time but his interest went into  flying. His wife was left with their baby
    daughter since her husband always did  exactly what he wanted and others had
    to live with it. Intelligent, talented,  and extraordinarily self-centered,
    he avoided human contact and responsibility  by escaping into the sky. To
    people outside the family, he appeared likable and  easy to get along with.
    He was so different at home with his children that John  felt that it must
    in some way be his (John’s) fault.
</p>
<p>
    His father left his family  and moved to Portland, Oregon, where in addition
    to flying, he taught  mathematics at a local high school. He remarried a
    woman who had kids of her  own. In his teens, John joined them for a while
    and found his father taking off  as usual because he had people he wanted to
    be with and they were not his  family. His wife shed bitter tears. Mostly
    his father’s friends were fans of  flying, mathematics whizzes, and
    athletes. John attended school knowing that  his <a name="page60"></a>father
    wanted him to be a letter man and a big man on  campus. To be accepted it
    was necessary that he be good at scholastics and  sports but he was good at
    neither. For a while, he played a halfhearted game of  football, but he
    “couldn’t stand banging up against people.” With his large and  muscular
    frame, one can easily imagine him as a star athlete, but obviously he  was
    unwilling to conform to his father’s conditions. He would not sell out.
    Instead, he sank steadily and progressively into the mire of rebellious
    failure. Perhaps failure was closer to the role that his father
    unconsciously  envisioned for him.
</p>
<p>
    He watched with rage and  despair when his father took a young student under
    his wing, treating him as a  friend. The boy was what John was supposed to
    be and in his place. As an  ultimate sign of buddyship, his father and the
    boy played golf together. John  could not mobilize himself to work at sports
    or academics. He was unable to  concentrate or study and classes were
    intolerably boring. He was turned off,  inattentive, and cutting up. He did
    very poorly.
</p>
<p>
    His feelings of resentment  toward his father found their way into the
    classroom, into problems with  authority. Reports of his poor conduct could
    not help but reach his father’s  ears. Perhaps John unconsciously wished to
    humiliate him. John felt little  sense of belonging since, due to his
    father’s changes of living place, he had  attended several schools. Overall,
    what sent John into a tailspin was the lack  of relationship with a father
    who knew and cared for him.
</p>
<p>
    Although terrible report  cards reflected only his rebelliousness and
    depression, John irrationally  believed that he had been correctly assessed.
    He joined the teachers in their  negative view and felt horrible about
    himself. The report cards reinforced what  he had already discerned from his
    father’s treatment, that he wasn’t worth  bothering about.
</p>
<p>
    John remembers the time he  broke the code of his father’s nonverbal
    gestures and really “knew” his  father’s opinion of him. He had just uttered
    a dirty word when his father  entered the room and overheard him. His
    father’s look conveyed the message,  “You’re nothing but shit.” The
    shoulders lifted in disgust gave the message,  “I’m finished with you. I
    give up.” John was later to hear these words spoken  to his face. He
    internalized his father’s evaluation and believed it true.  Every child does
    this. He took all the blame for how he was treated.
</p>
<p>
    He believed himself utterly  stupid. His brother’s grades were excellent
    <a name="page61"></a>while his were  abysmal. His father’s wife’s kids also
    got high grades. As an adult, John’s  mother told him that his IQ had tested
    exceptionally high, way above the  A-student stepsiblings with whom he was
    to live. But his younger years were  lived as an angry dunce. At one time,
    he and his brother cut school eleven days  in a row. Three points per day
    were taken from each of John’s grades, leading  to a long string of F’s,
    while Timothy’s grades were left untouched. This was  one more proof that he
    was inherently marked and doomed.
</p>
<p>
    When John was about thirteen  and still living with his mother, she made
    another unfortunate choice in the  man she remarried. John describes Ralph,
    her husband, as “brilliant but  driven,” one who could be the “sweetest man
    on earth,” or explode in rage.  Once, he threatened John’s mother with a
    knife and “threw her good stuff into  the woods.” When the couple fought,
    his brother, Timothy, and he would huddle  outside their bedroom door with a
    baseball bat ready to save her life. One  night their mother slept in the
    woods to hide from Ralph. The man was extremely  threatening.
</p>
<p>
    Yet John has no conscious  anger at the destructive male figures his mother
    introduced into his life, nor  is he angry at her for doing so. He speaks
    understandingly of Ralph’s  “problem,” the fact that he had a high-pressure
    job and took his tension out on  the family. I asked John if Ralph drank.
    After a pause, he answered yes. The  role of alcoholism as a partial
    explanation for Ralph’s conduct has been  underplayed. John has been
    inculcated into the family pattern of denying the  seriousness of drinking
    in its men. No foreigner to drugs himself, he has  turned to chemical
    solutions as a means of escaping from psychological pain  when no human
    succor was available.
</p>
<p>
    John never blamed his mother  for becoming involved with men who could not
    adequately parent her children and  whose problems made her inaccessible to
    them as well. It was as natural for him  to be without a father’s love as it
    may have been natural for his mother to be  without a reliable and intimate
    husband. Her own father had been hopelessly  narcissistic so she was used to
    being ignored and abused. If one were to  compare Ralph’s mistreatment with
    the sporadic availability and total  self-involvement of John’s father,
    Ralph was an improvement.
</p>
<p>
    Even before high school, John  was already disconsolate. His mother was too
    busy keeping her own head above  water to notice his <a
    name="page62"></a>psychological condition and he had  learned not to speak
    about such feelings. Communication about despair was  avoided by the entire
    family. They tended toward a manic hilarity, partying,  drinking, the young
    ones smoking dope, all running from their troubles. A  positive aspect of
    his mother’s personality was that she was not a worrier. She  gave John the
    gift of independence, was loving and trustful and not  overprotective. She
    supported the development of his adventurous spirit. At the  age of seven,
    he would bicycle ten miles from home. She gave him freedom but  would not
    share his burden of pain. He was very much alone.
</p>
<p>
    At around twelve, he was beginning  to get into his “suicide head.” His
    thoughts were filled with obsessive  self-loathing. There was little to hold
    on to and nothing to hold him back. He  was out of contact with the family
    who could have cared and, as usual, failing  at school. He desperately
    craved attention but could not request it in words.  He used a symbolic
    gesture to signal for help.
</p>
<p>
    His first suicide attempt was  kept secret. He tried to drink Clorox but
    could not get it down. Immediately  after abandoning this method, he sawed
    away on his arm with a blunt knife but  survived. No one ever learned of
    this practice run. The idea of suicide became  an imaginary door out of his
    misery. It was a bitter comfort, always open for  his departure. Suicide
    expressed the hatred of one part of himself for the  other. The part that
    hated had identified with his scornful father. It found  the rest of him
    unworthy and declared that if someone is not worth loving, he  is not worth
    keeping alive. The negative inner parent enjoyed the idea of  immolating the
    inadequate child within. Psychologically, the walls were closing  in.
</p>
<p>
    In the seventh grade, unruly  behavior and irreconcilable conflict with
    Ralph landed John in the formalized  hell of military school. The only
    relief was that he could smoke openly. There  was much physical abuse.
    Officers passing by would gratuitously smack students  on the head, school
    rings turned inward to leave a painful goose egg. Students  were punished by
    having to lean against a wall supported by their thumbs until  they
    collapsed. They had to do innumerable knee bends. Bigger boys attacked the
    small and all ganged up on John because he was an unrepentant free thinker.
    Military school was an exacerbation of the abuse he was used to at home.
</p>
<p>
    Again there was no one to  turn to, no one who could understand.
    <a name="page63"></a>His father had  disposed of him and was disinterested.
    His mother was overwhelmed by her  problems with Ralph. In military school,
    the idea of suicide became a fixation  whose impulse was periodically
    dispelled by the violent treatment he received  from others. They did the
    punishing for him.
</p>
<p>
    After a year in military  school, he returned to his mother’s home. He was
    there for half a year when he  went joyriding with a friend, another defiant
    and lonely boy. The only problem  was that his friend had stolen the car
    they were riding in. They were caught  and arrested. John was given the
    option of a reformatory or going to live with  his nineteen-year-old sister
    in Los Angeles. He chose the latter. At least it  got him away from Ralph.
</p>
<p>
    His sister was trying to make  it as an actress and dancer. Modeling
    provided subsistence. She received no  help from either parent. They had cut
    her off for having refused college. She  and her mother paid John’s tuition
    at a private school. Their father made no  contribution to his children’s
    upkeep.
</p>
<p>
    If John had been behind in  country schools, city private schools chosen by
    his sister were so much more  advanced that he felt hopelessly outclassed.
    The kids already had years of a  foreign language and he had none, and so
    on. He felt unable to live up to his  teachers’ or his sister’s
    expectations. Still unable to concentrate and apply  himself, he got another
    lousy report card. He still gave undue respect to  grades. Once more, he had
    been branded inferior.
</p>
<p>
    At fourteen, he made his second  attempt at suicide by throwing himself in
    front of a moving vehicle. He escaped  injury but his sister realized that
    he had more serious problems than she was  able to cope with. Still, no one
    asked him what was wrong. His sister also had  been raised in her family’s
    conspiracy of silence and was unable to relate to  the intensity of his
    self-hatred. She had the family rules down pat: Act  upbeat, strive hard,
    and look good for the world to see; do not complain or  make demands. She
    could no more relate to John’s suffering than she could  recognize her own
    pain. John had again been forced to take the nonverbal route.  The suicide
    attempt was a symbolic gesture announcing, “Hey, someone, help me.  I’m
    desperate and going under.”
</p>
<p>
    He didn’t get much help. His  father remained distant and breezy on the
    phone. He showed no desire to reach  out to his son and John’s
    <a name="page64"></a>ego was too fragile to allow him  to make a direct
    request. He couldn’t have taken further refusal and so veered  off the
    topic. His mother was too busy with Ralph; his sister had her career.  He
    was summarily shipped off to an aunt in Portland.
</p>
<p>
    It was painful to live with  his aunt and uncle while his father lived
    nearby with the “good kids.” His  father had always favored other people’s
    children over his own. John was  apprised of the fact that his father’s
    stepchildren were straight-? students in  the high school where their mother
    was a teacher. Any comparison between John  and the stepchildren put him in
    an unfavorable light. He continued to believe  that they were receiving
    something from his father that he was not, loved  because they got good
    grades. This was a self-destructive fantasy. His father  was no more
    available to this family than he had been to John’s own. He was  still
    totally self-absorbed and hanging out at the airport. That’s who he was  and
    couldn’t be otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    In school, fifteen-year-old  John continued to act out his despised
    self-image, unconsciously hoping that  someone would see through it. He was
    still the rebellious “bad boy,” the “tough  guy” who was incapable of
    learning and who played hookey. He received yet  another disastrous report
    card.
</p>
<p>
    Report cards were always the  event that tipped the balance of his
    relationship with himself, sending his  self-esteem into a downward slide.
    John needed the scholastic world to evaluate  him favorably and it failed to
    do so. His ego was shredding with no one to know  it. He resolved to die,
    bought several bottles of over-the-counter sleeping  pills, and went out to
    the beach of a nearby lake. He waded in to a depth where  he could reach
    down and bring the water up to his mouth. Cupping the water in  his hands,
    he took all the pills.
</p>
<p>
    His mouth was dry. He felt  nauseated. He vomited, then began hallucinating,
    hearing voices. Time passed.  His aunt and uncle came searching and found
    him by the lake. It hurt him that  it was they and not his father who had
    been looking. When they saw his disordered  state, they assumed that he was
    drunk and John did not inform them otherwise.  It was a kind of crazy pride
    that kept him from explaining, from asking them  for help. He returned home,
    where his father was waiting, not the least bit  interested in finding out
    what had motivated his son. The child was  condemned—again. The first words
    out of his <a name="page65"></a>father’s mouth  were: “Pack your bags, boy.
    I’m washing my hands of you.” According to his  father, he was an
    incorrigible waste to be dumped.
</p>
<p>
    The next day, or perhaps it  was that very night, he is not sure, John was
    on a train back to his mother.  The thing that troubled him was the enforced
    separation from his girlfriend. He  didn’t even realize how much it was
    going to hurt him to be without her.
</p>
<p>
    Back with his mother, it was  just the two of them. Ralph, her second
    husband, was gone. She was divorced and  living in a different rented
    apartment, on the road five days a week working in  sales. With this
    schedule she left John alone and he was increasingly morose.  He sat on the
    couch, which was his bed, shades drawn to make it as dark as his  mood. He
    played songs on the guitar and wrote many cards and letters to his
    girlfriend. He wrote the poetry of desperation. A few alienated friends
    joined  him in making music, singing mostly sad songs. He ached for the love
    of his  girlfriend, for someone to touch him in his solitude. His loneliness
    became  intolerable. Something had to give to break the hideous tension. He
    saw no  other way but to kill himself. This time the attempt was very
    serious.
</p>
<p>
    He got hold of the  barbiturates that his mother kept for headaches. He left
    himself an out in that  the attempt was staged at school, where there was a
    possibility of rescue. He  took the pills, fell unconscious, and was taken
    to the hospital where his  stomach was pumped. Then he was placed on a
    psychiatric ward.
</p>
<p>
    Although most of the people  there were far sicker than he, he liked it.
    There was no social facade to  maintain. Everyone was straightforwardly
    desperate. They were real. He made  friends with another suicidal boy and
    entered into the turning point of his  life. For the first time, he was able
    to communicate with honesty and depth.  John had never known that it was
    possible to emerge from the prison of  psychological isolation and be
    understood. He acquired a new perspective.
</p>
<p>
    John’s friend was determined  to die. He got hold of a razor and sneaked
    onto the elevator, away from  surveillance. He cut his wrists between
    floors. John says, “They put him  further back.” He never saw his friend
    again. Even so, his healing had begun.
</p>
<p>
    His father flew in for the  weekend to visit him in the hospital exactly
    once. It was an obligatory  gesture. John was not comforted by his cold
    demeanor.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page66"></a>Once out,  his mother sent him to a “fifty-dollar
    psychiatrist” who was short on sympathy.  He told John that he was
    “bullshitting” when he spoke of his fights with his  brother. John saw in
    the psychiatrist yet another rejecting male and quit  therapy for good. He
    never had much luck with father figures.
</p>
<p>
    He was out of school for the  rest of the year, accompanying his mother on
    her selling rounds. In his final  year he played hookey a lot, as usual. The
    only exception was Miss Nunnamaker’s  class.
</p>
<p>
    He showed up drunk in her  class and instead of sending him to the dean, she
    told him, “Go to the lavatory  and get yourself cleaned up.” He felt that
    she was genuinely concerned about  him, not just with the rules. He was
    inspired to work in her class, history, a  subject which he did not really
    enjoy. He got an A. It was his gift to her. He had  responded to a small
    degree of kindness. Perhaps he was ready to believe that  someone might find
    him worthwhile. He knew that he had made his last suicide  attempt although
    he was “still capable of the notion.”
</p>
<p>
    He went to college and did  extremely well. His father was “too busy” to
    attend graduation. He went to  graduate school in English but quit before
    completing his master’s thesis.  Pulling in the reins at the last minute
    became a pattern. He allowed himself to  demonstrate ability but not to
    complete the course. On one level, success might  mean trying to please his
    rejecting father. On another, it might mean replacing  him. He was trapped
    in a limbo of indecision about what to do with his life.
</p>
<p>
    He floundered through many  jobs. The unconscious taint of his father’s
    appraisal, that he was a “hopeless  fuck-up,” probably followed him and had
    its influence. At eighteen, he had a  first marriage that failed after
    producing in its second year a son who was  called Little John. The marriage
    split up in its fourth year and his son was  left with his mother, who soon
    remarried. John kept in touch with his boy, even  more as time went on. At
    the time of his birth, he may not have felt capable of  full-time fathering.
    His own experience of fathers had never been anything but  destructive. He
    may have feared the kind of father he would be with such models  and fled
    from too intensive and damaging a contact.
</p>
<p>
    With his discovery of Zen,  John made his first real commitment. It is
    suggestive that he characterized his  father as “unknowable in
    <a name="page67"></a>words.” A Zen meditator looks  beyond words to an
    ineffable reality within the quiet void of mind. John says,  “The authority
    of Zen is in the silence.” Perhaps he was trying to understand  his father,
    the Sphinx, by looking into silence. Perhaps he was trying to be  like him,
    the former minister.
</p>
<p>
    His father has played a  striking role in John’s life. John knows so much
    about him and yet has not yet  been able to create a unified picture. He
    keeps the bad father in one  compartment of his mind and the good father in
    another. He says that his father  is “incapable of making enemies,” and
    forgets the years of rage when his mother  supported a family of three
    children without assistance. He calls his father a  “gentle man … with
    sweetness in his character,” and suppresses all the memories  of being
    cruelly rejected, overlooked, and scorned. By keeping away the  negative
    images, he can continue to idealize a man who could be generous with  his
    friends when full of the bonhomie of drink or without it.
</p>
<p>
    John visited his  eighty-year-old father in the hospital where he awaited a
    dangerous operation  for an aneurysm. John was in his early forties and
    uncomfortable to find his  strong and silent father terrified. His father
    told him, “Be careful with  Little John. Otherwise you’ll lose him.” In
    these words, John believes he heard  an apology for all the years of
    rejection. But words are not enough, especially  where a narcissist is
    concerned. The words of a narcissist can mean very  little.
</p>
<p>
    And so it is with his father.  The old man uses easy, Western endearments,
    calls John Honey, tells him, “I  love you,” giving a twenty-dollar bill as a
    Christmas present to a son who can  really use a hand. Endearments had been
    reserved for his girlfriends, never for  his kids. As an old man, he first
    used affectionate terms but still refused to  offer financial help and spent
    only limited time with his children. This father  was unwilling to help his
    daughter set up her own business, even to cosign a  loan. His claim of
    insolvency was an obvious lie. He gives his money freely to  cronies and
    buys expensive presents for women he wishes to impress. His  children still
    do not count. Let them struggle. Let them sink. It is not his  problem.
</p>
<p>
    John needs to see his father  as he is. Parental idealization misconstrues
    reality and is destructive to his  development. If his father was “not
    capable of hurting a soul,” then John’s  wounds are his own fault.
    <a name="page68"></a>He must see that his father was  incapable of love,
    rather than see himself as a born loser. He can throw off  the role of the
    deficient child who is not worth saving and come into his own  power. It was
    not his fault that the paternal well was dry. It is time he  learned that he
    is worthy of love.
</p>
<p>
    There is hope for John if he  knows that he chooses to limit himself. He has
    to express his anger in ways  that are not self-destructive, to learn that
    he can love without losing his  soul and can be loved in a different way.

<p>
    This is the story of how our early experience with a narcissistic  parent,
    particularly one of the opposite sex, can lead us to choose similar  types
    to love. How else can we account for our choice of suffering? Despite our
    complaining we repeat the problem.
</p>
<p>
    We loved our narcissistic  parent although we may only remember pain. Adults
    often do not stay in touch  with their childish longings and satisfactions
    but develop an association  between the pain and love once felt. If our
    parent forgot his appointments and  holidays with us, we choose a forgetful
    lover. If the parent did not help out  at home, we <a name="page71"></a>end
    up with the household chores. Some of the  similarities between then and now
    may be exact. Some will follow a general  pattern. Like a lover who does not
    earn sufficient salary at a job different  from the one held by a parent who
    was a poor provider. Or a lover who does not  touch us with affection but is
    sexual in the same way we felt our parent to be.
</p>
<p>
    We look at our past with  hatred and do not see its resemblance to the
    present. It isn’t pretty or fun to  know that we love a person because he
    mistreats us in specific ways. It is  painful to realize that we are with a
    narcissist to get the love that we never  received from our narcissistic
    parent. We do not want this man for himself but  need his loving to prove
    our parent’s love. We have chosen a life without easy  pleasure when better
    is available. If only the past would loosen its hold on  us.
</p>
<p>
    Delores is my oldest and dearest friend. While  we lived in San Francisco,
    we had known each other through many years and  extended helping hands over
    life’s rough terrain. Because our fathers were  supremely narcissistic, we
    have trodden similar psychological mine fields and  emerged with related
    battle scars. We offer each other the understanding that  we never found in
    our families.
</p>
<p>
    I asked Delores to  participate in this book as an example of a “woman who
    loves too much” and she  agreed. Almost immediately, we ran into a
    characteristic snag since she barely  had a moment for a formal interview.
    We could talk only between spurts of  activity when she was in the throes of
    exhaustion. Delores is a whirling  dervish, dancing in a high wind. Her
    phone is forever ringing; she listens to  other people’s problems, giving
    instructions to the workers of her booming  interior design business. As the
    child of a narcissist, she has strong doubt  but stronger determination. Her
    bravado borders on arrogance. A talented person  who likes to direct
    projects, she is also the child of an unreliable narcissist  and allows
    other people to cheat her.
</p>
<p>
    She is ever planning her next  party, event, or dinner, imagining and
    inventing, purchasing or considering  purchasing. A business in
    <a name="page72"></a>home design grew out of her life  since she is always
    reaching out for new experiences and drawing people to her.  Once she talked
    me into buying a water bed, with the consequence that I slept  on the floor
    for years until I found a buyer.
</p>
<p>
    Delores told me a recent  dream that showed her fear. She is climbing a
    mountain, going higher and higher  until she reaches its peak. Before her is
    a drop off to emptiness. Filled with  anxiety, she must go down or fall off.
</p>
<p>
    In this dream, Delores saw  fear that her business will fail, that she will
    run out of ideas and be cheated  of success. My interpretation of the same
    dream had a different slant. The idea  that achieving great heights can be
    dangerous may relate to the grandiosity it  stimulates. Narcissism lurks
    within the psyche of every child of a narcissist  since we had such a parent
    to identify with. Rise too high and you can become  narcissistic. Getting
    out of touch with people is like a death.
</p>
<p>
    Delores is five years older  than her brother John, of the chapter on
    suicide. They have the same father,  cold, haughty, self-centered,
    interested in flying his plane and getting away  from his family. Delores
    spent her first five years without him because he was  flying in England for
    the RAF. He had left his family for a voluntary  enlistment right after
    Delores was born, which shows how little he cared for  his wife and child.
</p>
<p>
    During his time away, Delores  was raised by a somewhat narcissistic mother
    who focused on appearance, permed  and bleached the baby’s hair, and put her
    on interminable diets. Delores grew  up with a fantasy about what her father
    would be like, kind, sweet, and  physical, like her uncles who cuddled her
    cousins on their laps. But when he  returned from the war, it was different.
</p>
<p>
    He was cold and offered no  physical contact, attempting to rein her in and
    to remove the privileges she  had had with her mother. He responded to her
    assertiveness with dislike. In her  teens, she and her father argued when
    she neglected to call him sir, for which  he slapped her in the face. In
    some peculiar way, a slap from this oblivious  man meant he cared for her.
    He gave the same aggressive response followed by a  token of affection to
    her brother John. At the close of her father’s living  with his family, he
    left them flat, providing little subsequent contact and no  financial
    support.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page73"></a>By the  time of his departure, Delores was in her
    midteens, a scornful person who  didn’t want him to be around. Cynicism
    covered the memory of her early years of  pain, when her hopeful gaze was
    met by his coldness. She secretly blamed  herself for his response, thinking
    she wasn’t lovable, nice, acceptable, or  pretty enough to please him. His
    slap was one of the strongest responses he had  given her. Although she
    resented it, one must infer from her subsequent choice  of men that she
    unconsciously marked it as evidence of his love. In this way,  abuse became
    part of her model of being loved by narcissistic and abusive men.
</p>
<p>
    Tortured relationships with  men formed the centerpiece of our lives and the
    frequent subject of  conversation. Delores and I would talk about our
    boyfriends’ behavior and try  to help each other out. Men are the emotional
    center for many women, but not  always because they are upsetting. Men
    usually are valued because they offer a  woman security and pleasure,
    friendship, intimacy, the support of a helping  hand.
</p>
<p>
    But not ours. They were very  difficult to get along with. We couldn’t get
    close to them and be nicely  treated. We focused on them in an obsessive,
    addictive fashion and kept trying.  The worse it got, the harder it was for
    us to let go—up to a point. I chose men  who were intelligent,
    self-centered, and unwilling to make a commitment.  Delores chose men who
    were intelligent, dependent, and very abusive.
</p>
<p>
    The negative traits that  attracted us were no accident, although we were
    unaware of our pattern. Each  fell for her “ideal” man and was blinded by
    love. Suffering took a while to  penetrate. Unavailable and ungiving
    intellectual workaholics were like my  father. Abusive, intelligent, and
    demanding men who gave nothing and took  everything were like her father.
    Our unconscious goal was to turn these men  into loving, giving, and
    available partners. It was like trying to carve Mt. Rushmore  with a
    toothpick.
</p>
<p>
    We stood by each other  through incredible pairings and did not shame the
    other for it. Our  conversations were funny as we caricatured the latest
    mishap and absurdity to  which we clung. Laughter diminished the importance
    of the latest men who were  sandpapering our souls. We never felt secure
    with the guys who turned us on and  stimulated a painful yearning.
    Eventually, we got rid of our current disasters  but never spoke of the
    inevitable ones to come.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page74"></a>My men  would usually vanish on their own as soon as I
    pressured them to get close and  make a commitment. Delores’s men would
    immediately move in and weather her  attempts to get them to change their
    abusive patterns until she gave up and  asked them to leave. Her asking was
    soft and tenuous. They responded with  anger, smoked a joint, and generally
    ignored her.
</p>
<p>
    With Delores, the repetitious  element of abuse took many forms. Men
    promised her the world and secretly  expected it from her. Delores had her
    way of promising back. Her suffering had  a kind of sweetness and
    excitement. You could hear it in her voice when she  spoke to her
    hypersensitive mates, high and soft, as if singing a lullaby to a  baby. She
    chose her words carefully so as not to set off their nitroglycerine
    tempers.
</p>
<p>
    Her father also had an  explosive personality, demanding attention and
    consideration and giving none  back. As an old man, he visited without
    telling his kids that he was coming.  Summoned to his side, they had to
    procure his favorite cigars, feed him on  schedule, and drive him to his
    motel on command regardless of what was going  on.
</p>
<p>
    Some of Delores’s men have  included the following (I am omitting others no
    less difficult): a Coca-Cola  addict, hopped up on caffeine and sugar and
    constantly generating fights. Ten  minutes after I met him, we had an angry
    repartee about the effect of liver on  your health! He had escaped from a
    career in science to a backwoods hermitage  without running water where he
    made oddly shaped candles that reminded me of  the works of Charles Addams.
    He met Delores in a co-op where he sold candles  and she sold the paintings
    she was doing at the time. Delores put up with his  tantrums and tried to
    make him stop his Coca-Cola. He proved unregenerate.
</p>
<p>
    I first met Delores with her  husband, Jay, a charming and extremely
    irresponsible man who abused her with  his “meditative” lack of interest in
    the practicalities of life.  Irresponsibility had been a central trait of
    Delores’s narcissistic father, who  was unavailable when he was needed and
    later refused to support his family.  Delores’s husband was an otherworldly
    baby who held on to her for dear life.  She could not entrust him with the
    smallest task. He lifted his huge eyes to  the heavens when asked to contend
    with a task in “gross reality” and usually  would mismanage it. He was a
    follower of Eastern religion <a name="page75"></a>and  left the concerns of
    the world to God, guru, and wife, in that order.
</p>
<p>
    Jay was paid a subsistence  income for barely working in the firm of his
    wealthy, disapproving, and  rejecting father. Jay was used to being bailed
    out by his mother, for whom  Delores served as a substitute. Despite talent
    and artistic pretensions he only  dabbled at drawing and photography. His
    work had an otherworldly, vanishing  perspective and was presented to
    visitors to entertain them and gain  self-esteem from their appreciation. He
    had no interest in developing his  abilities to generate income.
</p>
<p>
    After Delores had their baby,  she had two children to take care of, Jay and
    her son. Her dreamer husband  would leave the house in unmatched socks and
    shoes tied with string. A  religious “fool” is above such things as
    appearances. Sent to buy milk for his  child, he would return hours later in
    an elevated state having purchased a rare  and holy book. The milk had been
    forgotten and the book was expensive. Delores  did not dare let him take
    their son shopping for fear that he would forget and  leave him in the
    supermarket.
</p>
<p>
    The only material thing that  concerned him was that Delores should not be
    long out of his sight. He became  hysterical when she came home later than
    expected, saying that he feared her  being mugged. Probably he was afraid
    that she would meet another man and leave  him. Which she did.
</p>
<p>
    He was one of a long line of  baby men who, with Delores’s encouragement,
    glued themselves on. Glueyness kept  them from walking out as her father
    once had done. She could control these men  by “giving” to them as she had
    done with father and brother.
</p>
<p>
    A few boyfriends after her  marriage came a spate with a revolutionist
    carpenter who liked his beer and was  charming and unreachable. As long as
    she catered to him, went dancing, and  smoked grass, everything between them
    was fine. On her birthday, he used magic  marker to write “Al loves
    Delores,” in huge black letters on the school wall  opposite their
    apartment. But did he? His revolutionary feelings were expressed  by ripping
    off society. It was but a short jump to abusing the woman with whom  he
    lived.
</p>
<p>
    Why is Delores attracted to  opportunism and lawlessness in men? Many of her
    men have followed this pattern,  leading quasi-predatory
    <a name="page76">
    </a>
    lives outside the mainstream and  finding their easiest victim in her. She
    was drawn by their ability to survive  in unconventional ways. So much
    oppressed was she by the numerous strictures of  her mother and father that
    their defiance seemed to spell freedom. She didn’t  see it as inevitable
    that they would also take advantage of her. Like other  women who “love too
    much,” her addiction to abuse is unknown to her. Where  better to find abuse
    than from an angry rebel who is looking for reparations?
</p>
<p>
    There were various kinds of  violence in her “love” relationships. A spoken
    word can be as hurtful as a  blow. Until I interviewed her for this book,
    Delores had never spoken to me  about her physical mistreatment, since the
    victim may consider such behavior to  be a humiliating thing. She may also
    secretly think that she deserves abuse,  which is why it and the
    relationship continue. We only discussed verbal  violence except for the one
    “accident” when she and her boyfriend were working  on their apartment and
    his hammer “somehow” flew through the air to hit her in  the head. She said
    that it felt as if there was something peculiar about this  but didn’t dwell
    upon it.
</p>
<p>
    She didn’t make a connection  between the present and her past with a father
    who had been violent as well. In  speaking of her love misadventures, she is
    like the woman who tells a friend,  “I don’t think my husband loves me
    anymore.” “Why?” asks the friend. “Because  he hasn’t hit me in a month.”
</p>
<p>
    I asked her more about  violence and she spoke of cursing and yelling,
    pinches, shoves, and slaps. Her  current man once pushed her to the floor
    and threatened her with a chair leg;  another time, he attempted to strangle
    her for asking him to contribute more to  household upkeep. Angry,
    terrified, disgusted, she nevertheless eventually went  back to him. In his
    savage passion she saw a sign of need and love. She felt  regret when
    battered by his cry—”Don’t abandon me.” Claiming to be depressed by  him,
    she finds a million reasons for remaining and does not see how his
    mistreatment  fits into her childhood experience of what she learned to call
    “loving.”
</p>
<p>
    Delores has always placated  men, starting with an angry narcissistic father
    who ignored her individuality.  He did not appreciate her physical beauty or
    ability to dance and disregarded  her need for affection and attention.
    Romantic partners followed suit,  transgressing <a name="page77"></a>against
    the principles which she does little  to make clear. Delores’s principles
    would include a fair exchange of services,  in which one party is not to
    assume the financial burden of the other. It would  include being mutually
    pleasant and responsive. She would have her men be  reliable and true to
    their word, but in this respect she is like her  narcissistic father and
    does not present a reliable and verbally trustworthy  image of herself to
    them. Their unreliability is complained about and accepted.  Hers is excused
    and overlooked. Delores does not set limits and is terrified of  using the
    word no. Not only do her boyfriends take  advantage, but also her son, who
    is dependent and undeveloped. Boyfriends, son,  friends all try to
    parasitize her since her behavior teaches them to take from  her without
    constraint and to ignore her needs.
</p>
<p>
    Her mother’s having to  placate her father and the way he treated his
    daughter taught Delores that a  woman’s role is to make the man comfortable
    by acceding to his every wish. I  have heard Delores complain in a weak,
    ineffectual voice that seems to say,  “Ignore me, I don’t mean it.” To me,
    she speaks of confusion, anger, and pain,  but her man does not hear much
    about it until her positive feelings for him  have been completely
    exhausted.
</p>
<p>
    Her series of boyfriends  included many surly ripoffs, drug users, name
    callers—demanding, insensitive  men. They were a series of emotional hair
    shirts of whom Delores said, “I loved  them all but I didn’t like any one of
    them.” It shocked her to speak this  thought aloud although she claimed to
    have always known it. Often, we do not  pay attention to our thoughts until
    something brings them center stage. Apropos  of this, our talking together
    did not set off vast insights since so much is  invested in remaining the
    same. Addiction to our painful quest keeps many  children of narcissists
    locked in unhappy relationships. I would say that  Delores’s primary insight
    from our discussions was learning that she encouraged  people to take
    advantage of her. In our last phone call, she said she was  taking a weekend
    course on how to make demands.
</p>
<p>
    In our discussions, there  were many questions and denials, such as, “How
    can I be choosing a man to love  me who resembles my father when my father
    loved me so little?” Delores doesn’t  see how a healthy supportive love
    affair and what she actually seeks are  different. Cutting
    <a name="page78">
    </a>
    through our defenses and fantasies takes  more than logic. If we cannot
    correctly see ourselves, we need to submit  ourselves to the insights of
    someone whose vision is more trustworthy. We must  break eggs to make an
    omelette and we must give up the ancient pleasures of  courting the
    narcissistic parent if we want to learn to live a different way,  enjoying a
    person who sees and accepts us as we are. When Delores read the  final
    chapter in this book, she resolved to fire the dependent and unreliable
    workers in her shop and to find people who would do the job.
</p>
<p>
    Although liking a person is  usually based in part on a realistic appraisal
    of how she or he treats us or on  objective characteristics that attract us,
    loving also comes from a deeper and  sometimes irrational place. The
    experiences of childhood can cause us to love  someone who doesn’t treat us
    well at all.
</p>
<p>
    Delores’s childhood was  broken up into three sections: the time before her
    father came home from the  war, the time he was home again, and the time
    after he had left for good. Life  with a narcissistic mother also affected
    her later relationships with  narcissistic men. Her first five years were
    spent with a mother who gave  dancing lessons to support the two of them.
    Mother was a feisty woman who  encouraged Delores to be creative and
    free-spirited. She was not the kind to  dwell on unhappiness or
    unpleasantness but would activate herself in a kind of  manic defense
    against depression.
</p>
<p>
    Mother’s narcissistic traits  kept her from accepting Delores for herself.
    Mother’s love was conditional, in  the narcissistic fashion. Delores had to
    meet her need for social status since  Mother believed that this would lead
    to happiness.
</p>
<p>
    She had been a model once and  Delores had to be equally popular and
    beautiful. Mother’s scrutiny sensitized  Delores to the least of her
    physical imperfections, like having a “pigeon”  breast (protruding
    breastbone). Delores was encouraged to think about ways to  hide her flaws
    and enhance her good points with makeup, dress, manners, and  charm. Before
    going on a date, she had to pass muster with her mother. The only
    acceptable words, to be heard with relief, were, “You look beautiful.” Such
    training led to a career in interior design—Delores could put people into
    fantastic settings that changed the way they saw themselves.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page79"></a>In  Delores’s mother we see the previous generation
    repeating the choice of a  narcissistic mate due to having had a
    narcissistic parent of the opposite sex.  Delores’s mother was the daughter
    of a narcissistic father, an arrogant man who  despised everyone as beneath
    him. He nicknamed his wife Nummy, short for  numbskull. His daughters
    obediently called their mother Nummy, as if unaware of  what the name
    signified. By denigrating her, they courted Dad’s approval and  sullied the
    image of women. Many children of narcissists come out hating  themselves and
    their sex.
</p>
<p>
    Delores’s mother told a story  about her own father. It was the height of
    the Depression and he was preparing  a tire for repair by soaking the inner
    tube in a tub on the dining room table.  His daughter was expecting a suitor
    and asked him to remove the tub so she  could use the room to entertain him.
    Father flatly refused. No one else  counted.
</p>
<p>
    Daughter grown up, she met  her future husband and was immediately smitten,
    enchanted by his looks, fine  manners, and excellent profession. He was a
    minister who knew how to “woo the  ladies.” She claims to have had no
    inkling of his narcissism but we all have  unconscious radar that tells us
    the kind of person we are with. Delores’s  mother had found a man like her
    father, one who would soak his own  psychological tires on her dining room
    table.
</p>
<p>
    After they were married, he  quickly showed his colors. He was disinterested
    in her family and separated  himself from their doings. He was not
    interested in their outings at the beach  where her family had a house,
    didn’t want to “schmooze” over lengthy dinners,  and didn’t like his work.
    His charm with the ladies was strictly for strangers.  All he wanted to do
    was to get family obligations over with and return to the  safety of the
    flying field where he gave lessons. Flying took him away from  demands that
    he give his family interest and love.
</p>
<p>
    After he returned from the  war, two more children were born, both boys. The
    family moved several times to  new towns to be nearer the airport. His
    congregation expected a generosity of  spirit that Delores’s father did not
    have. His boys were neglected and growing  up angry, having been treated by
    Dad with disdain and dislike. Mother got the  short end of the parental
    stick and probably resented her mothering duties  without support and
    appreciation from her mate.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page80"></a>Delores  says, “I had no use for him and his
    meaningless rules.” But when Delores was  eleven or twelve, the family took
    their meals in miserable anxiety. They would  all sit down to eat. Her
    father would hastily consume a bit of food, push back  his chair, and
    mumble, “Gotta go.” It was over and he was off. No talking and  sharing. The
    family hated feeling abandoned and began to gobble alongside him  so as not
    to be the ones that he left. Delores still hurls down her food in a
    self-generated race to finish quickly.
</p>
<p>
    It was an unhappy family  trying to put on a good face. Delores’s mother
    liked to play and didn’t want  the burden of raising her children without
    help. She saw salvation in Delores’s  tractability and increasingly turned
    to the young girl for help. Delores lacked  confidence in her ability to do
    it but, to get mother’s approval, replaced her  at baby-sitting.
</p>
<p>
    One time, Delores was sitting  in the backseat of the family car with her
    two rambunctious brothers, who were  increasingly out of control. Afraid
    that she might not be able to manage them,  panic drove her to act the
    charade of control, which calmed her brothers. The  unspoken consequence of
    her success was to turn her into a performer, a person  who could act a role
    that others would believe. Assuming such a role helped her  mother, who was
    resistant to the burden of her children’s miseries. Delores  fell into the
    pattern of acting like an adult to cover childish fears. But  covered fears
    are not outgrown. They smolder behind one’s defenses.
</p>
<p>
    Fear of separation rules  Delores’s life, much of which had its basis in her
    mother’s narcissistic  isolation as well as her dad’s abandonment.
    Separation anxiety often has its  origin in the period around age two when
    the child needs to practice separation  by coming and going from his parent.
    The child returns periodically for  “refueling,” which means to feel the
    parent’s happy greeting assuring him that  all is well. A favorable response
    shows that his independent action is  acceptable and that the parent will be
    there when needed.
</p>
<p>
    Two of the parental reactions  that can undermine the development of
    autonomy are if a parent can’t let go or  if a parent lets go too quickly.
    Often there is a combination of these two with  the parent listing from one
    side to the other.
</p>
<p>
    Delores’s moderately  narcissistic mother probably clung to her
    <a name="page81"></a>child at first as  an extension of herself. Once the
    child started to separate, mother hastened  the process because she was
    unable to tolerate the coming and going. Feeling  deserted by her husband,
    who went to war, the actions of her child exacerbated  such feelings, so she
    prematurely disengaged from the child and demanded full  autonomy of her. A
    child who is afraid that the parent will not be there upon  her return
    becomes an adult who is afraid to let go of her partner.
</p>
<p>
    Delores gives evidence of  such thinking in her early teenage baby-sitting.
    She felt deserted by her  mother when left in the car with her young
    brothers. It flitted through  Delores’s mind that her mother was not coming
    back at all. This relatively  adult fear of being left can be a repetition
    of the early childhood trauma she  experienced over her first move into
    autonomy.
</p>
<p>
    Evidence of a problem with  unreliable parents is passed on to the following
    generation. Delores’s son had  phenomenal powers of observation. I remember
    when he was about two and a half  and reminded me to take my sweater (which
    I was about to leave behind). It was  hanging on a hook in conglomeration
    with other sweaters. “Elan,” he said, “you  forgot your sweater.” When I
    asked him about this memory for the book, he said,  “I had to be totally
    observant because I was afraid that Mom would leave  without me. I had to
    keep my eye on everyone. I knew where all my backup people  were, you and
    Elsa and Rose, in case I got left.”
</p>
<p>
    We replay our traumas with  our children. A woman fearing that she will be
    forgotten by her mother and her  dad raises a child who fears that she in
    turn will be forgotten. Imparting  similar fears to our loved children
    reassures us of our parents’ loving motivation.
</p>
<p>
    These problems show up with  our mates and friends. Delores, who feared that
    her mother would disappear,  became an adult who cannot bear to be alone.
    She does not feel connected with  her “significant other” if he is
    physically absent. Having considerable beauty  and charm, she rarely lacks
    for companionship. The gaiety of her surface denies  the anxiety that lies
    beneath. More than just liking male company, she has to  have it.
</p>
<p>
    Fear of solitude is shown by  the immediate replacement of one departing
    live-in lover by another. She  promises herself (and her friends) to live
    alone for a while but cannot. The  speedy choice of her
    <a name="page82">
    </a>
    next man is helped by his dependency.  She plummets from man to man, a chain
    of men, with few intolerable moments of  emptiness between. Her choice of
    dependent men is fed by her unmet and early  need for an unavailable mother
    and father.
</p>
<p>
    As she grows fed up with the  current man, she is grooming the next. Her new
    man comes in the back door as  the old one goes out the front. In response
    to the power of her conviction and  his need for merger, the new man thinks
    he is the one who will last. For her,  he is a need-dependency-user man, a
    repeat of what led to the demise of the  relationship before. A man with a
    healthy ego takes longer to establish his  commitments since he looks before
    he leaps.
</p>
<p>
    Delores is like two people.  Her first analyst said that she was like
    “stones and water.” On the surface she  is a leader and trailbreaker; on the
    underside she is fearful and clinging, a  woman who accepts provocative
    abuse and is incapable of calling a spade a spade  or a punch a punch.
    People who know her well but are not predatory find it  difficult to believe
    in the huge disparities between her actions and attitudes.  Delores herself
    has not integrated the strength that she possesses. Having  learned
    self-abnegation from her father’s cold response to whatever did not  concern
    himself, she thinks that the price for assertiveness is desertion. Fear  of
    abandonment supports her choice of addicted, clinging men.
</p>
<p>
    And yet, there is another  side. The men she is so crazy for are secretly
    “boarders” with whom she plays  the role of submissive victim. This means
    that there is a power she keeps  restrained. If and when she wills it, she
    can show them the door. Despite increasing  financial independence her
    choice of men remains the same, as does the role she  plays with them. For a
    long while, she enacts the game of the little girl with  her narcissistic
    father, trying to get this self-centered man to love her  fully. When she
    tires of it and sees that the relationship is going nowhere,  she declares
    it to be over in a breezy and irresistible way. The man who has  been
    seeking a permanent berth and reveling in her undemanding approach  believes
    that he has made it into heaven. He is shocked to learn that this is  not
    his survival train’s last stop.
</p>
<p>
    Delores’s ego has grown  stronger as she sees herself capable of earning
    money. She feels the power of  ownership, bought a hot tub and a dishwasher,
    has with limited finances  landscaped her lawn. Her <a
    name="page83"></a>home had been creative but  rudimentary. Now, even her
    sheets and pillowcases match. But even with her  increasing power, she
    remains with David, her latest man, perhaps the most  violent, dependent,
    demanding, addicted, and ungiving of them all. David may be  closest to the
    model of her narcissistic father and she calls them look-alikes,  short and
    dark, slouched over with sardonic and disapproving expressions.
</p>
<p>
    Delores claims to not feel  “that way” about him anymore. Six years have
    gone by and he remains the same,  refusing to produce sufficient income and
    unwilling to leave. If pressed to  break it off, he throws a tantrum and she
    caves in. He accuses her of having  destroyed his life, which plays on her
    sympathy. He says that first she took  advantage of him and now wants to
    cruelly throw him out. For good measure, he  adds the threat of suicide.
</p>
<p>
    David doesn’t try to please  Delores sexually. When I asked her why she
    didn’t get a different lover, she  said that her work took all her energy
    and she didn’t care much about sex. In  this rationalization there is the
    unstated pleasure in her pain. She said that  despite all the negatives,
    there is comfort in his companionship.
</p>
<p>
    I was there at the outset of  their relationship and saw how unconscious
    paths are followed, how Delores got  embroiled even though she knew better.
    It was like eating an apple in the  Garden of Eden. “Just one bite and I’ll
    eat no more.” Once eaten, there’s no  turning back.
</p>
<p>
    I was visiting Delores that  afternoon. As we were together in her car, she
    saw David tooling around her  neighborhood on his bike. They’d met the
    previous day and perhaps he hoped to  run into her. Delores and I were
    coming back from shopping when she spotted  him. I saw his dark hair and the
    pure, soulful expression of an angel. Although  I too was taken in at first,
    I later learned that his choirboy act was a cover  for a satanic ego. He
    held on to her hand through the open car window, and  looked at her with
    melting eyes.
</p>
<p>
    He invited us to visit him  right away and we accepted, following his bike
    in her car. It was the first  time that Delores had seen his place, a small
    cottage set among trees in a  quiet neighborhood, college digs in an idyllic
    western town.
</p>
<p>
    We entered the living room.  Before us, a kitchen, two bedrooms, and a bath.
    On the inside of the front door  was a space-age poster with physics
    formulas on it, some kind of insider’s  joke. Also he had an
    <a name="page84"></a>incredible collection of books and  records, esoteric
    odds and ends, all declaring “herein lives a head.”
</p>
<p>
    From our freewheeling conversation,  he appeared to be extremely
    intelligent. I later learned that he had been  valedictorian of a large
    western high school. His level of education and plans  were not discussed.
    Delores didn’t care about his major and when or if he was  going to
    graduate. She wanted to know if he was going to be fun!
</p>
<p>
    I was interested in such  things and concluded that he was one of those
    young men who hang out at a  university for an indefinite time, sometimes
    taking classes but never  completing the degree. Time limits, degrees,
    vocation have nothing to do with  the leisurely experience of getting an
    education. He is a college “lifer,”  considerably younger than Delores and
    considerably older than his classmates.
</p>
<p>
    Our time together was very  pleasant until we were interrupted by the knock
    and entry of his landlady. She  was very angry because she claimed that he
    owed her a considerable sum of  money. His roommate was gone and he
    persisted in paying only half the rent. How  long the roommate had been
    gone, we do not know. How hard David sought  replacement is a moot point. He
    occupied the house alone. He felt that looking  for a roommate was enough to
    abrogate his responsibility, that the landlady was  an irrational pest who
    wasted his time. He treated her with a combination of  annoyance and
    boredom. Why didn’t she take her petty problem and disappear?
</p>
<p>
    In the car on the way home,  the drama we had witnessed alarmed me. I
    babbled my anxious thoughts to  Delores. “He’s a freeloader of royal
    proportions. The world is owed to him. He  thinks only of himself and has no
    conscience about extortion. Don’t get  involved.” She agreed with me
    wholeheartedly. She usually agrees with the wise  counsel of her friends—and
    then goes straight ahead, propelled by forces that  have little to do with
    her ability to think.
</p>
<p>
    That night, Delores had a  premonitory dream in which her unconscious mind
    was attempting to save her. A  vampire bat was buzzing around her throat and
    she was extremely frightened. We  discussed the dream. The vampire bat was
    this new man who was looking to feed.  A classic vampire plot shows a
    heroine who succumbs to chthonic forces and  sleeps while they consume her.
</p>
<p>
    I left Delores at the end of  my visit thinking that she had resolved
    <a name="page85"></a>to nip the  relationship in the bud, for that is what
    she told me. Years later I recognized  that when Delores spoke of a
    relationship that made her unhappy, it was not  with the intention of
    withdrawing. She was ventilating her unhappy feelings so  that she could
    continue with the man.
</p>
<p>
    David moved in by inches;  first his cartons were stored in her garage and
    then loose items in her house.  Little by little came the man himself. He
    was working sporadically and beneath  his native capacity. At first, he
    drove the local bus—when he got up in time.  Delores sometimes joined him on
    his route before she went to work, giving it a  party atmosphere. He often
    went to work late and took absences, not wanting to  disturb his precious
    mental tranquility with trivial obligations. He had a roof  over his head
    and didn’t need to make the rent.
</p>
<p>
    He pushed away the stresses  of tawdry reality by smoking a lot of homegrown
    grass, something Delores  overlooked when trying to understand his
    lackadaisical behavior. She had a way  of turning a blind eye to addictive
    behaviors that caused her trouble. Her own  drug use made her insensitive to
    its effects on others and led her to deny its  consequences. She smoked pot
    quite often and did acid occasionally as part of  the custom of the hippie
    culture.
</p>
<p>
    She was at the beginning of  her painting business, achieving a degree of
    fame through paintings of  prehistoric beasts, friendly dinosaurs that
    munched on leaves and toothy  tyrannosauruses. She sold these paintings at
    fairs. David would take off from  driving the bus in order to accompany her.
    He would help her set up her display  and then hang out. His companionship
    pleased her. She only became dissatisfied  when she realized that he did not
    want to work hard and would let her foot the  bills. He didn’t always come
    up with his share of the rent and food money. He  ran up phenomenal phone
    bills to a large family that was far away, saying  high-handedly that he
    would pay for his phone bill when he had the money. He  never thought of
    depriving himself at the moment. Delores was supposed to take  up the slack.
</p>
<p>
    He showed how much he loved  dependency when he squandered a
    twelve-thousand-dollar inheritance from his  deceased aunt. Delores begged
    him to use the money to learn a skill,  bookbinding, in which he was
    interested, or the cooking which he loved.  Instead, he bought himself toys,
    including a synthesizer that he never learned  to play since
    <a name="page86"></a>lessons were not part of his budget. Practice  was too
    much like work. He preferred to doodle in music, free-form and stoned.  His
    inheritance was quickly spent.
</p>
<p>
    Delores was horrified,  infuriated. Her ethic of work made her hate his
    profligacy. At least he should  get good at the synthesizer. Her pressure on
    him to use his money wisely was  responded to with infantile rage since he
    wanted to remain on an eternal  vacation. Grass made this seem to be a
    feasible approach. On one of my later  visits, I asked him what he intended
    and he said, “I’m waiting for my ship to  come in.” But his ship had already
    come and he had sunk it. In private Delores  told me that his current ship
    was the S.S. Delores.
</p>
<p>
    She stayed with him. Or  rather, he continued to live with her, responding
    badly to any request and  often sabotaging what he did when forced to
    comply. He broke her rules,  rejecting her needs in a callous manner. If she
    asked him to feed the dog, he  strewed her fine, hand-thrown plates around
    her backyard. A thousand requests  would get something accomplished but she
    would pay for it.
</p>
<p>
    He lived by the motto, “What  is asked for will not be given.” His memory
    for literary fact was phenomenal,  for personal requests imbecillc. It was
    shades of her narcissistic father. Sex  was poor since he refused to do what
    she asked and didn’t remember her  requests. If she put his hand where she
    wanted it, he would resist and remove  it as soon as she stopped holding it.
    He was rigidly and obstinately  unprogrammable. She didn’t look forward to
    sex with him and put forth the  rationalization that they were like an old
    married couple. However, the real  issue was that David would not give.
</p>
<p>
    He hated women. His father  had died of alcoholism and his large family was
    held together by a controlling  mother who would beat him to the point that
    he feared for his life. All the  world now consisted of strong mothers who
    would pay for his suffering.
</p>
<p>
    Years went by. David claimed  to be extremely depressed, as if depression
    accounted for his nonfunctioning.  Perhaps he was depressed at functioning
    so poorly, but as an addictive person,  his primary motive was hanging on to
    the host. Friends asked Delores what she  was doing with a man who was not
    only predatory but not nice. He didn’t  compliment her for the things she
    did around the house. His mouth was often  compressed in a thin line,
    eyebrows raised in disdain. His attitude <a name="page87"></a>was, “With
    such petty things do you occupy your life.” And he  used those things. He
    ate her food, listened to her records, used her phone,  slept in her bed.
    She hated and loved this abuse. Like many children of  narcissists, she is
    addicted to the prickly, miserable, ungiving, self-centered  meanness of the
    unloving narcissistic parent.
</p>
<p>
    David had been abusing her  financially for a long time, like borrowing her
    son’s car, which she had just  refurbished in order to sell it. He then used
    the car for months! Even more  fantastic was Delores’s inability to ask for
    it back. She could only approach  him with a supplicating murmur. “David,
    please, I need the car.” For a long  time nothing happened. Repairing his
    own car would take money that he lacked.  He further ran down her car and
    reduced its monetary value.
</p>
<p>
    Delores’s fury was mounting  beyond containment. Perhaps she had developed
    the sense that she could survive  without him when she told him to come up
    with more money and laid out his areas  of insufficiency. She pushed him too
    far. How he hated aggressive women with  their endless demands! His big
    hands went around her throat, pushing her  against a wall with her wind cut
    off, out of breath, feeling strangled. It was  no joke.
</p>
<p>
    When he let up on his grip  she was injured. Her neck was painful. A
    vertebra was out of place. Terror  penetrated her denial. For once, she
    couldn’t bury her emotional experience and  told her friends, who panicked
    for her. They knew that she would forget her  terror, and they saw real
    danger in the couple staying together. Later, he  blamed his violence on her
    PMS! When Delores told me of this event, she said  that he had hurt her
    before this time as well.
</p>
<p>
    Her friends got her to put  him out and change the locks. They asked her to
    go for an order of protection  from the police, which she kept putting off
    as her mind started to bury the  incident. One could feel her fear and the
    memory of his violence seep away. It  was scary to watch this happen. When
    she had to go on a business trip and her  plants needed watering, who did
    she ask to do the job, which necessitated that  he have the key? Her friends
    did not know of this. By the time she returned  from her trip, David had
    once more ensconced himself in the house.
</p>
<p>
    David remains with Delores.  Little has changed except that time has moved
    on. He has been destroyed by his  unwillingness to stand on
    <a name="page88"></a>his feet. Growth usually needs to  occur within the
    appropriate developmental periods or it doesn’t catch up. She  still thinks
    of getting rid of him but turns most of her energy to business.  Sexual
    affairs can be carried on in distant cities on business trips while he
    remains in his ignorance at home. She considers trading him in for a new
    man,  but remains with the pleasure of his abusive ways. He gives her very
    little and  she continues to get something emotional from it.
</p>
<p>
    When Delores first got into  painting, she did a magnificent work showing a
    unicorn with two heads. The head  looking forward into the future was a
    unicorn with a powerful horn. Looking  backward was the head of a
    traditional woman, wide-eyed, vulnerable, sweet, and  pretty.
</p>
<p>
    The unicorn is a phallic beast,  narcissistic in that it needs no one and
    others need it. Its horn is a symbol  of masculine power, like the symbol of
    the narcissistic male as distinguished  from the female helplessness to
    which Delores was raised. At work, with  friends, she can be aggressive and
    even ruthless. She can use people, getting  around them with her charm. She
    accrues power and radiates a narcissistic  luminescence.
</p>
<p>
    The backward-looking maiden  is transfixed by her past. It is the submissive
    female who chains her man with  her own enslavement. It is the delicate
    woman who cannot raise her voice or say  no. Her true love is the
    narcissistic and vanishing father of childhood. She  never gave up her need
    for him because she is not in touch with the feeling.  She is unconscious of
    the origin of her replay. Blindly and compulsively, she  chooses men who
    feature the most narcissistic and worst traits of dear old Dad.
</p>
<p>
    These two heads looking in  different directions are unaware of each other.
    They operate in different  spheres and from different aspects of her
    personality. The forward-looking head  denies the influence of the past. The
    backward head is too caught in its dream  to integrate. Each represents an
    extreme.
</p>
<p>
    To heal the rift, Delores  needs to slow down and to take a look at both.
    Her current lifestyle is  probably too successful to make her want to deal
    with the suffering that her  backward head is causing her, or to look at the
    suffering that the forward head  is causing others. Perhaps later. She is a
    formidable lady and quite a  remarkable one. As her brother once said to me,
    “Our family matures late.”
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page89"></a>Delores  and I are trying to learn to treat ourselves
    and others well. We remind each  other of our need for love, knowing that
    the only one who can move us toward  love is ourselves. We must learn from
    experience in order to change, although  the hardest thing to change is
    one’s definition of love. We want to love a  different kind of person and to
    experience his generosity as love.

<p>
    The narcissistic parent puts what he feels is unacceptable in himself  onto
    his child, but the child does not realize that she is a repository,
    accepting instead whatever the parent feeds her as the truth. A child
    presumes  good intentions since the alternative is too frightening to
    consider. In this  story, as in the story of John, a child is forced to deal
    with her parents’  critical lack of love.
</p>
<p>
    Here we have Elan, a girl of eleven staying in  the country with her mother.
    Her parents are recently divorced. Her mother  hates her ex-husband
    <a name="page91"></a>with great intensity. She is a hater by  nature, and
    additionally is on the rebound from twelve years in the service of  his
    narcissistic grandiosity. She received no thanks. His philosophy was to
    verbalize only fault. If you couldn’t appreciate yourself, you were out of
    luck. Neither mother nor child was capable of doing this.
</p>
<p>
    Typically, even though both  parents had full-time jobs, Mother came home to
    do the cooking, cleaning,  washing, ironing, and serving. Father read his
    newspaper. He had been trained  to do this by his doting and narcissistic
    mother, who demanded that her boys be  “geniuses,” thereby creating in them
    vast feelings of inferiority and a need to  overcompensate. Elan’s mother
    remembers her mother-in-law weeping when she saw  her son, the college
    graduate, washing dishes after his wife had cooked and  served. She had
    stated to herself, “I too am a college graduate.” But her need  to create
    bonds through dependency due to abysmal self-esteem, which made her  expect
    rejection, had kept her serving. Now it was over.
</p>
<p>
    She was enjoying her first  weekend away from work in many months in the log
    cabin that she had acquired  with her ex-husband. Her dealings with the
    little girl were extremely unstable  and changeable. Even though she loved
    the child very much, her pressure-cooker  personality led to constant verbal
    explosions of rage, to endless criticism,  and to an insistence that she do
    for the child what the child wished to do for  herself. She did not want her
    child to be independent because here, too, she  saw in that the potential
    for abandonment.
</p>
<p>
    Reeling from the blows of  both parents’ criticism and caught in her
    father’s egocentricity, the little  girl had become extremely compliant. All
    she wanted was to be sheltered from  the endless rain of blows to her ego.
    The child needed to find value in herself  and some purpose for living. Her
    escape route and salvation was nature.  Communing with animals, her mind
    sailing on the wings of birds, her senses  drunk with the scent of flowers,
    lulled by the buzzing of bees, she was free.
</p>
<p>
    She was an artist, creating  an ecstatic and loving world to go to. When one
    finds a child of a narcissist  who is relatively intact after surviving a
    horrendous childhood, one should  look for the making of art. Art heals.
</p>
<p>
    She was what was, for her, an  approximation of happy when old Mr. Etzel,
    the proprietor of the general store  a quarter of a mile away,
    <a name="page92"></a>came limping down the road. They  had no phone. From a
    distance, he called out a breathless message. “Your father  just called.
    Your grandmother’s died and the funeral is tomorrow.” He heeled  around and
    started back up the road.
</p>
<p>
    She didn’t know how she was  supposed to react. She had no good feelings for
    this grandmother, who took an  interest only in her grades, which were never
    good enough. What was she  supposed to do? She looked to her mother for
    guidance.
</p>
<p>
    This was her mother’s first  vacation in a long time. She didn’t want to
    drive straight back to the city.  Besides, she had hated her mother-in-law
    and could express her hatred through the  little girl without quite
    recognizing that she was doing so. She did not allow  herself to recognize
    the effect that the child’s actions would have on the  child’s position in
    her father’s family.
</p>
<p>
    She told her daughter, “You  do not need to go back today. There’ll be
    enough time to be with the family  tomorrow night.” The girl accepted her
    mother’s decision with a feeling of  trepidation. Why would her father have
    called if he did not expect something of  her?
</p>
<p>
    And yet the city was so far  away. Whenever she was with one parent it was
    as if the other resided in a  foreign country. Her father was distant in any
    case. He kept poor contact,  calling infrequently, and was always at least
    two hours off the appointed time  of his visits. She would sit looking out
    the window experiencing waves of  mounting hysteria, not knowing if he would
    come at all. She needed him so and  her mother did nothing to relieve her
    anxiety. Her mother’s focus was on hating  her ex-husband, not on comforting
    her child.
</p>
<p>
    He had treated his daughter  as one who counted for very little and her
    mother had seconded the motion. She  obliged them both by feeling so. A
    worthless person does not give her own  opinion much respect. She buried her
    anxieties about what her father might  think if she did not come
    immediately. Her mother had often helped her to shirk  responsibilities in
    the past.
</p>
<p>
    The next evening, she entered  her grandparents’ apartment. She walked the
    long, dark hallway into the  interior rooms. At the end of the corridor she
    saw her aunts and uncles sitting  on packing crates. The mirrors were
    covered with cloth. She saw her father at  the same time that he saw her. He
    walked toward her. Was it grief that was  constricting <a name="page93"></a>
    his face? His expression seemed to hold  something else, something vaguely
    ominous. He seemed angry. He steered her back  down the hall to its darkest
    point, out of earshot of the relatives. What he  had to say was private,
    between the two of them. As she walked she noticed the  familiar old bronze
    vase atop the bookcase and the two charming Chinese painted  lamps with
    streamers and dragons. Then she remembered her mother saying that  after he
    moved out, her father had sneaked in and removed these objects from  their
    home when no one was around. Her mind was empty, vague, and disquieted.
</p>
<p>
    Her father was grasping her  shoulder with his bony fingers, piercing her
    eyes with a pained and accusatory  stare. He was speaking. “… you have
    betrayed me.” The child attempted to pay  closer attention to what he was
    saying. He was speaking about her not attending  the funeral. She had
    committed a crime. She would not be allowed to blame her  mother for staying
    away. That he held her responsible for being a poor  grandchild, although he
    exaggerated and she had been abetted by her mother’s  resistance to her
    going and unwillingness to drive her there, also touched upon  her readiness
    to feel guilty.
</p>
<p>
    He spoke in conspiratorial  tones. His voice was grieving yet angry. “Your
    grandmother always loved you.”  This must be part of her deficiency, since
    she was unable to feel that love.  “Your not attending the funeral was …” He
    was searching for the perfect weapon.  She felt the knife poised above her
    with the satisfaction of one about to be  immolated. “… it showed that you
    really are … unable to love anyone.”  Satisfaction came from serving her
    constant role as victim, which met his need  and hopefully made him happy.
</p>
<p>
    The knife struck. She felt a  fierce pain. Then went numb. The truth was
    out. Something inside of her gave  way, the thin gray thread that bound her
    to other people. Her true self tumbled  to the bottom of a deep well,
    leaving only a feeling of emptiness. Now she  understood her father’s
    endless attempts to correct her, her mother’s rages and  accusations. She
    had lost her shaky standing as a human being since the coin of  love is the
    only real interchange between them. Love generates love and she was
    bankrupt.
</p>
<p>
    From now on, she would shun  close contact. She would stay deep inside
    herself, looking out at the world as  if through a periscope. Where were her
    feelings? Gone. Her father had declared  it so. Her self
    <a name="page94">
    </a>
    lay in shambles at the bottom of the sea.  Hope for the future was
    eliminated. All the years of questioning and torture  now made sense.
</p>
<p>
    Years later, after many years  of psychotherapy, she comes to a realization.
    Amid tears of joy she sees that  she loves. She has always loved. Her
    father, confronted by his mother’s  deathbed, found himself unable to feel
    for the person who had been closest to  him. How could he avoid accusing
    himself of heartlessness—unless he could put  the fault onto a scapegoat.
    His daughter was to be sacrificed. He was safe.
</p>
<p>
    The person who could not love  was really he.

        ICTORIA
    </a>
</h1>
<p>
    Because the child of a narcissist is battered from earliest
    childhood—criticized, ignored, manipulated—he or she tends to develop a
    powerful negative introject, an inner representation of the rejecting
    parent.  The introject embodies the demands the child is supposed to meet in
    order to  gain parental approval. We have seen strong examples of this
    negative introject  in previous chapters, as when Anne could not drive her
    customers to their  destinations. The introject also embodies parental rage
    at the child for  failing to meet his standards, as when John grew utterly
    depressed for not  getting good grades. <a name="page97"></a>Because the
    introject is so harsh, it  can never be fully integrated into the
    personality as a normal conscience. It  leads a person like John to make a
    suicidal gesture for doing poorly at school.  The negative introject always
    feels like a foreign, attacking entity. Its  cruelty comes from the
    unmitigated hostility of the parent as well as the anger  of the child at
    his frustrations.
</p>
<p>
    Internalized anger and harsh  inner rules need to be softened and balanced
    by the experience of parental  love. This is how one develops a reasonable
    conscience. But for the child of a  narcissist, love is in short supply.
    Therefore, the negative introject remains  destructive and takes up the
    parent’s cause from inside the child, hating him  and telling him not to do
    and be.
</p>
<p>
    A person raised by  nonnarcissistic parents also has internalized rules and
    consequences. He feels  “signal anxiety” when contemplating an action that
    goes against his value  system. If he transgresses, he may suffer a degree
    of guilt and even some mild  depression. This self-imposed punishment keeps
    his behavior under the control  of his system of morality.
</p>
<p>
    Anxiety, guilt, and  depression are kept within reasonable bounds since his
    conscience is modeled on  his parents’ reasonable attitudes. Normal parents
    basically accept their child  even when he does wrong. They condemn the bad
    behavior without rejecting the  child.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, the negative  introject acts from within as a punishing enemy.
    It creates such severe anxiety  that it paralyzes, produces such powerful
    guilt that the individual feels  totally worthless. Depression, guilt, and
    inner conflict tear the person apart.
</p>
<p>
    Since the desire to reform  and control was an important motivation on the
    part of the narcissistic parent,  this becomes part of the intentions of the
    negative introject. When a person  suffering from a powerful negative
    introject falls in love, the loved one is  reacted to as a part of the self.
    When we fall in love, there is a merging of  ego boundaries
    <a name="page98"></a>and a sense of oneness. This brings into play  the
    aggression of the introject, which starts criticizing and reforming the
    loved one, who now is subject to one’s personal self-hatred. The sudden
    switch  from total love and acceptance to hatred and rejection causes the
    loving  persons to doubt their own sanity. They will painfully come to doubt
    their  ability to love. Such is the story of Victoria.
</p>
<p>
    Victoria is excited. A new day has begun and her  changes are unmistakable.
    Arrogance is giving way to sympathy, irresponsibility  to order. She is less
    selfish and greedy, more considerate. She is beginning to  like herself. To
    herald these changes, she has developed a sexual relationship  with a man.
    This is after a five-year hiatus of cloistered lesbianism.  Lesbianism can
    be a healthy sexual choice or the result of self-deprivation. In  Victoria’s
    case, having had a mother who called her inadequate and kept her  from her
    dad resulted in a lifelong inhibition of her heterosexual urges.  Victoria
    fears that no man would want to be with her.
</p>
<p>
    The previous six months had  been full of agony as the probe of therapy
    opened the trapdoor to her obsessive  self-loathing. She had been drowning
    in it, had undergone a major psychological  house-cleaning, and now it was
    over. Relief seemed to be in sight. Seemed to  be.
</p>
<p>
    To top off the list of  changes, she had begun to take care of her body,
    that aspect of herself that  she had always treated as an unacceptable
    burden. Before, she had only abused  it, would binge on sweets and ignore
    nourishing food, get fat and take diet  pills to slim down, smoke
    cigarettes, drink alcohol, and trip on psychedelics.
</p>
<p>
    If she exercised at all, it  was because she was forced to. She hated being
    confronted by her image in the  mirror, seeing all that jiggling flesh.
    Suddenly, when the self-hatred abated,  she discovered her body. She was
    like a baby exploring its toes. She entered  into her body and moved it
    around. She liked breathing hard after exercising,  feeling the ground solid
    beneath her feet. She liked to stretch and pull her  muscles and was
    beginning to feel alive all over. She started having orgasms  during sex.
    Her orgasms were not as good as other women’s, of this she was  sure. But
    they were orgasms.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page99"></a>All was  going rather well until the arrival of Kali,
    which is what she named the  feeling of driven hatred for weakness in
    others, especially in those she was  close to. She didn’t only hate their
    weaknesses, she hated them for having it.
</p>
<p>
    Kali is the Hindu deity of  world destruction. She is a terrifying vision
    with a blackened face and a  necklace of skulls draped around her neck.
    Half-devoured human bodies fall from  her mouth. Kali is not a pleasurable
    identification.
</p>
<p>
    Victoria felt that her own  self was lost, buried in the goddess and carried
    along by her wrath. Her  Kali-self attacked people she cared for, wounding
    them over and over. She hated  herself for harming but was drawn with the
    same addictive power that she felt  toward all destructive passions in her
    life. Once in the vortex of rage, she  had to explode.
</p>
<p>
    Her words were meant to  expose faults. They were uttered with utmost scorn.
    She unleashed lethal words.  She demanded that her target change his or her
    behavior on the spot to become  more effective. She rationalized that she
    was a surgeon cutting out rotting  flesh, only the surgery was not elective.
</p>
<p>
    Most of all, she hated her  boyfriend for his weakness. It is no accident
    that she had chosen a man who  could not fight back, since that was the
    trait she despised the most. After  knowing him about half a year, they
    decided to take an extremely exotic trip.  This destination represented the
    need of both to get away from ordinary life.  Victoria especially sought
    freedom from her narcissistic mother’s control by  delving into the
    esoteric. The hope that one can leave behind what one carries  within one’s
    mind is usually quickly dispelled.
</p>
<p>
    Her Kali-self was a constant  during their long vacation. In Bangkok, her
    boyfriend insisted that they stay  in a hotel described in his travel guide.
    He liked to be guided by authority.  The hotel turned out to be inadequate,
    perched on a noisy intersection where  the beeping of taxi horns and ringing
    of bicycle bells was deafening. Standing  in the center of their room, they
    had to yell to be heard over the roar of the  traffic.
</p>
<p>
    Victoria didn’t want to stay.  Her boyfriend did. He always resisted change
    since the known was less  frightening than the unknown. She spoke to him
    scornfully. “Look at what you’ve  chosen. This place stinks. Only an idiot
    would put up with it. I’m leaving and  if you don’t <a
    name="page100"></a>come, I’ll go without you.” She rose. He got  up,
    silently trudging beside her. As they walked the unfamiliar streets she
    continued her attack. She hated him because he so clearly manifested her own
    fears. He was supposed to be the strong one, but he wasn’t.
</p>
<p>
    She got him to ask directions  of a passerby who knew some English. Almost
    immediately he got confused over  what he had heard. Victoria called him
    stupid. After stammering out his  befuddled directions, he fell back into
    sullen silence. She knew that she was  turning him into a helpless baby. He
    never fought her directly but withdrew.  Her mood of despair deepened when
    he insisted on having lunch in the same  restaurant they had gone to for
    breakfast. Why was she with such a ninny? She  wanted to claw his bland
    face. She resorted to ripping words instead.
</p>
<p>
    He did not make love to her  that night. He had not made love to her for
    weeks. He went to bed early. She  sat on the bed berating him for his low
    energy level, which made it necessary  to get ten hours of sleep. The more
    she nagged, the sleepier he got, sinking  away from her into oblivion. Once
    he was asleep, she felt abandoned and was  conscience-stricken once more.
</p>
<p>
    She became cold with fear.  Wouldn’t he eventually leave her, the only man
    who had ever offered a  commitment? His leaving seemed as intolerable as his
    staying. She hated his  submissiveness.
</p>
<p>
    He demonstrated the same low  energy, slinking away from conflict, that she
    had once manifested in her own  family, a hive of manic aggression. Then she
    had been the one who passively  succumbed. It was her mother who reviled her
    for being a shy introvert.
</p>
<p>
    Her mother was the classic  narcissist. She had what it takes to be the
    center of attention: an extremely  beautiful face with porcelain skin, blond
    hair, a fine figure, brains,  ambition, and extreme feistiness. Despite the
    above, she was unbelievably  insecure.
</p>
<p>
    Like many insecure people,  she was grandiose. She needed to be worshiped as
    a supreme being. Victoria and  the rest of the family, her sister and
    father, deferred. The main focus was her  mother’s looks. Victoria still
    believes that her seventy-year-old mother is  more beautiful than she.
</p>
<p>
    Her father’s role was to run  interference for his wife, to see that her
    glory was properly heralded. He was  her exclusive possession. His
    <a name="page101"></a>eyes and words were for her  alone. He would tell his
    daughters, “Girls, your mother is a knockout, the  greatest, a killer, the
    best-looking at the pool, etc.” Looks were the most  important thing in the
    world. But what about his daughters? Didn’t they have  looks too? They were
    not about to hear about it from him.
</p>
<p>
    Victoria worshipped her  mother, who “got it all,” but held on to the
    secret, disloyal wish that her  father would beam a few words of praise her
    way. Her mother’s unwritten law  determined that he was to make no contact
    with this daughter. Victoria and her  father were to be the mother’s slaves
    and to relate only through her. As a  result, Victoria did not sufficiently
    develop her heterosexual identity. In our  culture, the father defines the
    female role. It is through her interaction with  him that the child learns
    how to be a woman. But Victoria was allowed to relate  only to her mother,
    who continually attempted to renovate her into an  acceptable state. As her
    mother’s possession, she was not to have the pleasure  of men. This is one
    foundation of lesbianism. Being raised by an emotionally  withholding mother
    who turned her from men also led her to seek the love of  women.
</p>
<p>
    Her mother had been raised by  a destructive mother, a paranoid who hated
    and rejected this child. Victoria’s  mother had to deal with intense
    self-hatred. Instead of openly questioning her  own worth she unconsciously
    placed her feelings of inadequacy onto the one  nearest, her daughter. From
    the safety of her remove, she could hate and reject  Victoria’s faults
    without ever recognizing that she herself was the subject.  Victoria had
    been raised to believe that she merited her mother’s scorn. She  saw herself
    as disgusting, “more a toad than a woman.”
</p>
<p>
    She surrendered to her  mother, the “all-knowing one.” She swallowed the
    pain of personal attack and  palliated her misery also by oral means,
    bingeing herself senseless. In grade  school, she was already “a little fat
    girl.” She felt as she looked, awkward,  incompetent, and hopeless. The
    appetites of her body were out of control. As  her physical appearance
    changed, she grew frightened. She no longer recognized  herself. Could those
    be her thighs? Was she inside that increasing mound of  blubber? When the
    body loses its natural shape, the mind also grows distorted  since body
    image and intactness of mind are intimately connected.
</p>
<p>
    Amidst the fusillade of her  mother’s attacks, she began to hear the
    <a name="page102"></a>distant babble of  hallucinated voices, like the sound
    of a radio when the pointer is between  stations. That terrified her. She
    was saved from a full descent into madness by  her older sister’s
    uncharacteristic willingness to listen to her problem,  reassuring her that
    she was not alone. Her sister and she were usually isolated  from one
    another. Victoria was her mother’s emotional property and her sister  was
    her dad’s. It was rare that Victoria could share what she was feeling with
    another being. Instead of communication, there was only the terrible force
    of  her mother’s verbalized hatred presented under the guise of love. There
    was not  one thing in her life that Victoria could hold on to, not one thing
    about  herself that was worthy of respect.
</p>
<p>
    Food became the center of her  existence. Food represented love. The
    availability of food meant security. She  spent her entire allowance on
    candy bars and crammed them into her mouth, six  at a time. She made
    midnight raids on the refrigerator to wolf down ice cream  out of the
    plenteous supply that was always to be found.
</p>
<p>
    There is a double message to  a child who is a compulsive eater when the
    family keeps ice cream and other  high-calorie foods on hand. Double
    messages were the rule here. Victoria’s  mother would tell her, “You must
    diet. I want you slim,” and then provide the  fattening foods her daughter
    found irresistible. The covert message, of course,  was that Victoria should
    eat, that fatness was acceptable, even desirable. But  why would her mother
    want to do this to her? The answer was obvious. Victoria  was turning into a
    beauty. Her mother could not accept a rival.
</p>
<p>
    Like the Wicked Witch in Snow  White, she needed to hear her mirror say,
    “You are the fairest of them all.”  Along with the intention of improving
    Victoria’s appearance, which represented  a projection of her own fear of
    ugliness, there was also the opposite need, to  maim and undermine her
    rival. Her improvement campaign drove Victoria into the  shadows. Victoria
    had intimations of her own beauty but also believed the  opposite about
    herself. She accepted the destruction of her looks as the  vehicle to her
    mother’s acceptance.
</p>
<p>
    Let us follow the history of  Victoria’s mane of blond hair, her glory. It
    was so long she could sit on it.  Everyone admired this hair, her most
    beautiful feature. Her classmates regarded  it as a communal treasure. She
    felt that the color and length of her hair gave  her value. In a family that
    worshiped looks, her hair was her most important  feature.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page103"></a>She was  an undisciplined child, a chatterbox whose
    main comfort in life was talking to  her friends. She repeatedly got low
    grades in conduct. When she was in about  the fourth grade, her mother
    decided to make a federal case of it, and  threatened to cut off the hair
    unless her conduct mark improved. Victoria was  panicked and told her
    classmates, who shared her fear and banded together to  write a communal
    letter begging her mother to spare the hair. Even her teacher  got involved,
    not wanting to be the lead agent of a massacre. He upped her  grade in
    conduct.
</p>
<p>
    Presumably the grade was not  good enough, or perhaps her mother was already
    set on the punishment for other  ancient crimes, for the hair did come off.
    Her mother wielded the scissors,  snipping until the uneven strands were
    shoulder length. It no longer fell  beneath Victoria’s waist, no longer
    rested beneath her buttocks when she sat.  She felt very diminished and
    depressed. She believed that she had somehow  deserved the punishment.
</p>
<p>
    A second assault was made on  her glorious blond hair like a halo around her
    face (it was glorious again  since hair will grow back) when she was about
    fourteen. Her parents had gone  out. A self-conscious and overweight
    Victoria had sauntered into the kitchen to  make herself a sandwich when a
    group of boys from her class happened to pass  by. They looked in the
    window, catching her in the act of eating. Because of  her weight problem
    this so embarrassed her that she covered up by acting  sophisticated, and
    invited them in. Usually, she was not so accessible.
</p>
<p>
    The boys had made themselves  at home in her living room when her parents
    drove up. They were astonished to  see male heads go sailing by the window
    in the usual hyperactive way of  adolescents and jumped to the incredible
    conclusion that their reclusive  daughter was in the midst of an orgy. They
    resolved to catch her in the act.  Their latent violence was ready.
</p>
<p>
    Her mother took the front  door and her father the back. At a given moment,
    they exploded into the house.  The boys scattered and escaped but Victoria
    was their actual prey. They pursued  her into the kitchen as she fled before
    them.
</p>
<p>
    Not a single question was  asked. She was thrown to the floor. They shoved
    and kicked her until her mother  spotted the kitchen <a
    name="page104"></a>shears hanging on a hook. Instantly the  blond hair came
    off in ragged hanks.
</p>
<p>
    Later Victoria contemplated  her mangled head in the mirror. Her once
    beautiful hair stuck out at odd  angles. Her usual sense of having something
    special about her appearance was  gone. She had already forgotten their
    absurd accusations of illicit sex and  connected the incident with her sin
    of eating a sandwich. At least that made  some kind of sense. She had broken
    her diet, hadn’t she? Victoria attempted to  find order and justice in her
    parents’ actions. She didn’t want to think that  she was living with
    irrational tyrants. That would be too much to assimilate.  She withdrew
    further.
</p>
<p>
    Victoria tells one final hair  story. She was about to leave for college and
    felt extremely insecure about her  appearance, although she had managed to
    diet down a bit. Her mother came up  with a new suggestion for improvement
    that involved reshaping her hairline. She  was to shave her forehead to
    create a widow’s peak instead of her own natural  hairline. So she shaved
    her forehead, convinced that she was ugly without heavy  makeup and all the
    subterfuge of illusion. Acceptance depended on this elusive  beauty. She was
    living her life on thin ice.
</p>
<p>
    Now let us look at the other  depredations orchestrated by a narcissistic
    mother on her daughter’s body.  Preoccupied with Victoria’s weight, she
    mocked the girl’s overeating and  despaired of her ever being slim. While
    harping on her diet and on  self-control, she bought an abundance of
    extra-large and shapeless clothing for  her and stuffed the refrigerator
    with high-calorie desserts, which were  forbidden to her child. Such
    behavior belied her stated desire that Victoria be  slim and seemed to
    endorse obesity. Victoria accepted her mother’s verdict that  she could not
    master her problem.
</p>
<p>
    At puberty, her body  ballooned out, sprouting breasts that were rapidly
    becoming huge. Her mother  stuffed those breasts into long-line bras that
    were boned to the hips. Rather  than disguising their size, the bras made
    her breasts stand out like  battleships. Her protruding belly was
    constricted by a rubber girdle with holes  in it that tortured her flesh by
    creating rubs and puckers and leaving her  stomach dotted with small red
    marks that faded after a few hours without the  girdle. She concealed her
    breasts and belly beneath a billowing man’s shirt or <a
    name="page105"></a>walked around in a long coat regardless of the season.
    Boys  had begun to show an interest in her breasts and this rather
    frightened her.  Nothing in the way her father had treated her as a child
    had prepared her for  the sexual desire of men.
</p>
<p>
    By then her mother, who was a  nurse, had introduced her to diet pills to
    help her control her eating. With  the pills came the implicit message, “You
    are weak and will have to depend on  outside agents to keep yourself in
    line.” The stage was set for further  addictions, the first, of course,
    being diet pills. In time were added alcohol,  sugar, tobacco, and diet
    shots. Victoria was to be a person propped up from the  outside, always
    seeking a new crutch to lean on to help her to control her  unruly self.
</p>
<p>
    In junior high school and  before any of the other girls, her mother
    introduced her to makeup in order to  correct her “fish eyes,” till then a
    deformity of which she had been unaware.  Her mother said Victoria had fish
    eyes because her lashes were too light. Now  she felt even more like a
    freak, first because of her fish eyes, which needed  correcting, and second
    because she was the only girl in her class in makeup.  All she really wanted
    was to fit in with the rest of the kids.
</p>
<p>
    Her mother encouraged her to  enter summer stock as she had done in her
    youth. Her mother’s many instructions  were directed at helping her daughter
    create a dramatic mask to hide behind.  Victoria was being induced to
    develop the defenses and attitudes of narcissism.  Off she went to summer
    stock in her heavy makeup and men’s shirts. Theater  helped her develop the
    art of seduction. She used her manner and appearance to  gain the interest
    of men but quickly discarded anyone who tried to get too  close.
</p>
<p>
    She developed a crush on a  pathetic bearded alcoholic in the company. He
    represented Victoria’s discarded  self. They drank together and kept their
    masks in place. She acquired beautiful  diction, a clipped, stage English,
    and the same imperious manner she had always  admired in her mother. If
    anyone had asked her how she actually looked and came  across, she wouldn’t
    have had the foggiest notion. She was all affectation and  no substance. Her
    true self was in hiding.
</p>
<p>
    Her mother engineered one  final and major attack upon her body, the most
    devastating and irreparable of  all. Victoria had returned home
    <a name="page106"></a>from her first semester at  college. She had been very
    erratic, strung out on amphetamines and unable to  concentrate. Overeating
    had been the only means of bringing herself down. She  would steal other
    girls’ diet pills and add them to her store. Hoarding them  increased the
    magical power that kept her from coming apart.
</p>
<p>
    When she came home for school  break, the young woman was huge, monstrous
    and passive as a stone. She refused  to leave the house and chance being
    seen by someone she knew.
</p>
<p>
    Her mother had a brainstorm.  As usual, her method of helping focused on
    appearance. Why did she continue to  think that direct work on appearance
    was the answer to psychological problems  when such solutions had never
    helped before? Narcissists do not ask such  questions. They are like the
    surgeon who announces, “The operation was a  success but the patient died.”
    Lack of humility is the mark of a shaky ego. It  leads to the inability to
    learn from mistakes. One must go on doing the same  things as proof of one’s
    infallibility. In addition, the mother was still  projecting her own
    ugliness onto her daughter and felt compelled to ameliorate  it.
</p>
<p>
    This time she focused on her  daughter’s breasts. They were too large and in
    need of “remediation.” A breast  operation would change those “cowlike
    udders” into “nice, high, girlish  breasts.” Fat was to be sucked out of
    each breast from the bottom. Victoria  went along passively, as usual.
</p>
<p>
    She emerged from the  operation with two ugly scars, like the toothless
    grins of old men. That is how  she presented their image to me although I
    have never seen them. She said that  a lover later reacted with concern,
    which confirmed the worst of her fears. She  was deformed. Her scars would
    be in her mind any time she had to disrobe to  make love with a man.
    Wouldn’t his face fall in disappointment when he saw? By  virtue of
    distraction, the tire of fat she put on around her middle actually  helped
    disguise the scars.
</p>
<p>
    Despite her powerful  self-hatred, she managed to graduate from college and
    then from graduate  school. She became a social worker who was a
    psychotherapist. Many children of  narcissists go into the psychological
    helping professions, being well schooled  to be sensitive to the needs of
    others. She was neither a success nor a failure  at her work. Believing
    herself a failure, she would never stick long enough at
    <a name="page107">
    </a>
    practice-building to get anywhere. She read signs of her  inadequacy in the
    usual difficulties of getting started.
</p>
<p>
    Programmed to be an  underachiever by her mother, she took far too many
    breaks to establish patient  trust. She was sabotaging herself and
    rationalized it by saying, “I just had to  get away. I am too sensitive to
    the noise and ugliness of the city.” Each time  she returned from a lengthy
    trip, a significant number of patients would have  left. Unconsciously, she
    was still clinging to her mother by having an  unsuccessful professional
    life.
</p>
<p>
    Still, Victoria never stopped  studying and learning, partly out of an
    exaggerated insecurity fostered by her  mother. She was always broadening
    her understanding of psychotherapy. She would  call her mother for a booster
    shot of self-doubt, describing her latest project  or course of study. Her
    mother would respond with predictable scorn, saying,  “Why would you want to
    study a peculiar thing like that?” Or she would plant  the seed of doubt by
    asking, “Do you really think you can do it?” She reminded  Victoria of her
    rightful place in life, somewhere beneath her mother in all  things.
</p>
<p>
    Though her lifestyle was  nominally hedonistic, Victoria was fulfilling her
    narcissistic mother’s edicts.  She neglected and undermined her profession,
    health, appearance, and desire for  a male lover. Everything constructive
    was avoided. All that remained were the  secretly addictive and destructive
    pleasures condoned by her mother. She still  had the glamour of marvelous
    red hair and blue eyes, an elegant face, and  theatrical expression. Beneath
    her glamorous facade, Victoria felt despair.
</p>
<p>
    Let us fast-forward through  the years. A first therapist who limited
    Victoria by accepting her as the  lesbian that she didn’t want to be was
    replaced by a second who saw other  options. Thus far, Victoria has not been
    very happy with either women or men as  lovers. She has always played the
    Kali game against them and hated herself as a  result. A person who hates
    herself cannot much love her partner. Sexual pleasure  has been limited with
    partners of either sex. The man is never considered  strong enough or
    thought to have an adequate penis. The female lover is thought  devoid of
    the necessary organ and pleasure with her deemed unimportant. Sexual
    confusion reigns.
</p>
<p>
    Is it only Victoria’s  self-evaluation that says any orgasm she has is
    <a name="page108"></a>not good  enough or is she truly holding back?
    Victoria has sex with her boyfriend, a man  who, like her father, accepts
    peace at any price. She reviles him and hates  herself for persecuting him.
    She is in her mother’s role, acting toward him as  her mother did toward her
    father, as her sister did to her boyfriend. She is  acting as she vowed she
    never would.
</p>
<p>
    She wants the impossible,  that her submissive boyfriend will stop her. She
    wants him to release her from  the maternal introject (inner parent) of her
    Kali rage. She wants to set free  the man in her female-dominated father.
    She wants to be a woman who can be  sexually close to and satisfied by a
    man.
</p>
<p>
    Homosexuality can be a  neurotic sexual choice but it doesn’t have to be.
    Victoria’s sexual orientation  is ambivalent and unclear. Raised to be her
    mother’s possession, she accepted  not being with men. Now she fears the
    rejection by men because she feels  inadequate. Although attracted to men,
    she is separated from them by scornful  arrogance, the concealing mask she
    copied from her mother.
</p>
<p>
    She believes that she has  never had a satisfactory orgasm with either a man
    or a woman. However, it is  hard for a person with a poor self-image to
    assess her own experience. She  desires to be sexual with men. Motivation
    has a lot to do with what we become.  If Victoria can undo her conflicts
    over sexual pleasure and her fear of a man  touching her, she may come to
    enjoy a sexual relationship with men.
</p>
<p>
    With her current boyfriend,  at times she attains a measure of objectivity
    and knows that her behavior is  unjustified. Often she is overwhelmed by the
    urge to criticize and she feels no  mercy for her victim. After her Kali fit
    is over, she feels horribly guilty and  ashamed.
</p>
<p>
    To free herself, Victoria  needs to know in her guts, not merely in her
    head, that what she hates in  others is the weakness she finds in herself.
    The desire to hurt the weak  directly expresses her identification with her
    mother, who attacked her for weakness.  If her boyfriend is timid, so was
    she. If she hates him for spending too much  time in the bathroom, so did
    she. Her parents hated her for being a bed-wetter  and a pants-wetter. (They
    had traumatized her by starting toilet training far  too early.)
</p>
<p>
    What she does to others is a  replay of what was done to her. Her boyfriend
    is a mirror for her weak and  despised inner child, closely connected with
    her true self. If she can find  compassion for her own
    <a name="page109">
    </a>
    weakness and timidity, she will  become kinder to him and her true self will
    begin once more to grow.  Kali-hatred cannot exist with compassion.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, when her mother  criticizes and corrects her, she does not have to
    accept the assignment. She  can give up courting her mother’s love by being
    the repository of her mother’s  hatred.

</h1>
<p>
    Nick is the son of a severe narcissist who crushed Nick’s natural self.
    This injury is evident in Nick’s lack of motivation and enthusiasm. His
    story  shows how his father progressively demoralized him and created
    emotional  paralysis. Nick thinks himself unworthy of anything positive. Due
    to the  process of identification with the aggressor, Nick continues to
    treat himself  and others in an abusive way. He continues to exist on the
    slave level where  his father originally placed him.
</p>
<p>
    He is terrified by the  extreme destructiveness of his negative inner parent
    (negative introject) and  lives his life <a name="page111"></a>partly in bed
    like a little baby to protect  himself and the world from its aggression. He
    fears that he will be murdered  from within if he becomes autonomous and
    starts living. The model for this  murderous introject was his father,
    himself full of rage. He may actually have  sexually assaulted Nick as a
    very young child, although Nick’s memories of the  possible event are
    represented only symbolically by his dreams.
</p>
<p>
    Nick’s resentment at having  been subjected to his narcissistic father’s
    will is expressed indirectly. He  does not even know that it is anger that
    directs him to the path of negativity.  He destroys his career, leaving his
    father nothing to boast about; he avoids  social activities so that his
    father will be deprived of grandchildren. His  lack of funds creates
    indebtedness, which shows his power over other people,  etc. He is ignorant
    of the rebellious nature of his passivity and so is unable  to change it.
    Nick thinks only that he (Nick) “doesn’t care.” He needs to  develop the ego
    strength that will allow him to say no directly to the external  parent who
    still attempts to direct him, but most of all to the threatening and
    punishing inner parent (the negative introject) that would crush him. He
    needs  to declare, “Even if you don’t approve, it’s my life now.”
</p>
<p>
    Nick told me of a dream. He is standing on a  rock surrounded by a dark and
    angry sea. Waves lap at his ankles. He is alone.
</p>
<p>
    In another dream, he is  standing on a dilapidated dock surrounded by
    rotting piers, abandoned boats,  and the stumps of fallen-down jetties. He
    feels like a hobo, at one with the  flotsam and jetsam of the sea. He has
    nowhere to go.
</p>
<p>
    Nick’s father has also  contributed a dream. In it he was conscripted into
    military service but didn’t  want to go because the job could be dangerous
    and unpleasant. He thought, “I  shall send Nick instead.” This appears to be
    a good solution. Nick is  expendable while he, the father, is not.
</p>
<p>
    Nick’s waking life also has  the quality of a dream. He is somewhat
    <a name="page112"></a>detached from  reality. Often he does not work but
    lies in bed watching TV, getting up only to  go into the kitchen to make a
    pot of spaghetti, which is then eaten with the  requisite quarter stick of
    butter. Nick rarely eats anything else. He is  overweight.
</p>
<p>
    Nick turns away from  commonplace necessities, laughs off monetary problems,
    and borrows money from  his friends. He often forgets to return the money
    but is so generous with his  time and energy that his friends let the debts
    slide. Nick postpones and delays  all decisions. He is procrastinating his
    way through life. He has no sexual or  love relationship and has not had
    either for a long time. A relationship would  take too much effort. Too much
    would be expected of him.
</p>
<p>
    He leads a life devoid of  options. He can see things happening only one
    way. There are overtones of  fatalism and defeat. As long as Nick can lie
    snuggled in his bed, he is safe.  He has the rosy cheeks and wide-open eyes
    of an infant, one without a care in  the world. Nick has never grown up,
    although he is approaching forty. Adulthood  could be too dangerous. He is
    the irresponsible child who has let the bills  accumulate and binges on ice
    cream and spaghetti drenched in butter.  Fortunately, he is a talented
    architect and when work comes to him—he never  looks for it—he will do a
    fine job. He is not a self-starter, but once the  engine is turned on, he
    can work. He learned to be a compulsive and meticulous  worker from his
    father, who demanded that he give his all. First he repaired  his father’s
    boat and car and then began to think about design.
</p>
<p>
    But Nick derives no pleasure  from his work nor from life itself.
    Architecture is what he is doing until he  figures out what he “wants to do”
    with his life. Other people might be  overjoyed to have such a skill, but
    Nick is fully capable of wasting it. He  says that talent is not compulsion.
    “Why should I be compelled to do something  that I don’t enjoy just because
    I’m good at it?” Nick’s life indicates that he  is not committed to
    anything.
</p>
<p>
    The only thing that Nick  respects is friendship. He is a true friend to
    other people, although not to  himself. He will paint his friends’
    apartments, schlepp their furniture, even  offer free architectural advice
    since “it’s not worth anything anyway.” He also  listens freely to problems
    and offers sound advice. He gives away much of his  time and energy, and
    when he works he undercharges. He gives little to himself
    <a name="page113">
    </a>
    in the way of pleasure, except food. He stymies all his own  wishes. If
    anything interesting is happening in the world outside, something  that
    appeals to his friends, he generally walks away from it.
</p>
<p>
    Nick has always walked out on  life. This started in kindergarten when he
    strolled away from class because “it  didn’t interest me.” Years later, he
    walked out of his architecture class in  the middle of his final year,
    thereby managing not to get a degree. An architect  can function without a
    degree. People learn of Nick’s ability and call on him  to work for them.
    But being without a degree or license has left him  handicapped, since
    others have to sign his work. He is eligible for the  licensing exam since
    architecture is a field where experience can be  substituted for classwork.
    But Nick does not take the exam. He rationalizes  self-castration by saying,
    “The exam and degree are not important,” and “I  don’t know what I want to
    do,” and “I don’t care.” His most characteristic  comment is, “I think I’ll
    stay put.” This is given in response to any  suggestion that he shift gears,
    whether to have fun, expand his talent, meet  new people, or leave the
    shelter of his home.
</p>
<p>
    How was such a talented and  compassionate man turned into a limpet, a
    person leading a life without  meaning? Let us begin with his father, the
    narcissist. Nick’s father was a  self-centered tyrant raised by distant
    relatives who had no affection for him.  Eventually, he became a sea
    captain, which suited his defensive needs  perfectly. A captain can indulge
    his need for sadistic dominance with lucrative  returns while serving a
    socially useful purpose. Every narcissist was once a  rejected child. It was
    too dangerous for Nick’s father to let people become  necessary to him in a
    personal way.
</p>
<p>
    He re-created the same  structure within his family as on board his ship.
    The family were his crew,  slaves who jumped to fulfill his whims and
    endeavored to meet his  perfectionistic standards lest they be subjected to
    his cutting attacks. Nick’s  father frequently lashed out in verbal rage
    over trivia. He was obsessed with  cleanliness and would pounce on such
    crimes as a footprint on the deck of his  pleasure boat or an object not
    returned to its proper place. He had something  critical to say about most
    everything. He liked to mock people and would tease  his son about his baby
    fat or the way he walked. Nick was under constant  scrutiny and became
    unbearably self-conscious.
</p>
<p>
    His father attacked Nick’s  ego. He especially liked to pull practical jokes
    to humiliate his son.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page114"></a>Nick was  about eight years old and attending a
    private elementary school. On this  particular day, he was serving detention
    as he had done on so many other  occasions because he had not done his
    homework. The other children were out  playing in the yard during a free
    period when his father happened to pass by.  Seeing that Nick was not among
    them, he made inquiries as to what had happened.
</p>
<p>
    That evening there was  company. Nick’s father started to quiz him in front
    of the guests, who were a  good audience. They were laughing at his father’s
    jokes and not showing a  smidgen of feeling for Nick’s situation. Such folk
    are often the friends of  narcissists and are sometimes narcissists
    themselves or children of  narcissists, trying to win the narcissist’s
    affection. Nick did not know that  he was being set up. He did not think
    much about his situation. It was too  painful. He lived his life in an
    emotional fog.
</p>
<p>
    “How did school go today?”  his father asked. “Fine,” Nick answered and he
    was not even lying. Detention  was an unremarkable event. “Did anything
    happen to you?” “No.” And so it went  until the story of Nick’s detention
    was drawn out of him, at which point the  entire company, led by his father,
    laughed uproariously. Nick squirmed in  humiliation.
</p>
<p>
    A second memory of the  progressive extinguishing of his self occurred when
    Nick’s father forced him to  betray his feelings. Nick was crying because
    his father had hit him for doing  something wrong. What it was he cannot
    remember. He was about five years old.  His father did not like the sound of
    Nick’s weeping. It might have made him  feel guilty over abusing the child.
    On a deeper level, it probably stirred up a  memory of his own hated,
    abused, and rejected inner child, the weak part of  himself that he
    despised. He needed to cancel out any reminder of that  vulnerable part, to
    attack it sadistically as he, the child, was once perhaps  attacked by his
    foster parents.
</p>
<p>
    He glared at his son and  said, “Nick, I want you to stop crying
    immediately.” Nick felt confused. His  father’s expression was mean. He
    wanted to please his father to gain his love.  His father said, “Nick, I
    want you to laugh, right now.” Nick’s inner world  spun with the abruptness
    of the transition. He laughed. He surrendered his  sense of self in order to
    win approval and with that surrender he turned to  stone. He felt nothing.
    He was only going through the motions of human  interaction. Some vital
    inner connection had been broken. It went on like <a name="page115"></a>this
    for an endless series of surrenders. This particular  event stands out in
    Nick’s memory because it symbolizes a high degree of  self-rejection as well
    as having been an emotional trauma.
</p>
<p>
    In a final memory, Nick’s  father’s ship had returned to the States after a
    year in Japan. Nick was  standing on the dock eagerly awaiting his father’s
    appearance. At the age of  nine, he was excited and filled with expectation.
    Every little boy loves and  needs his father no matter how he has been
    treated. Nick jumped up and down  scanning the people on the deck.
</p>
<p>
    Suddenly he saw his father  walking down the gangplank and rushed forward,
    arms outstretched. When Nick  reached his father he was pushed away. His
    father would not embrace him. It is  possible that the man felt shy about
    showing emotion in front of his crew, but  later, in the privacy of their
    home, he still did not put his arms around his  son. Nick felt annihilated.
    He said, “I felt as if I didn’t count. I was a  nothing.”
</p>
<p>
    What sustains all people is  the belief that they are lovable and that they
    will be loved. If your parent  cannot love you, then who will? Nick’s father
    had extinguished that hope.
</p>
<p>
    The child does not blame his  parent for not loving him. He cannot let
    himself see that his parent may lack  the ability to love because then he
    would have nothing to live for. It would  destroy hope for the future.
    Instead, he believes that the fault lies within  himself and can still be
    corrected. Yet in accepting that he is responsible for  his parents’
    rejection of him, he is so devalued that his self is destroyed. If  the
    child is treated as nothing, he must be nothing.
</p>
<p>
    One irony of Nick’s situation  is that he acquired so many of his father’s
    narcissistic traits. Nick’s mixture  of attitudes is found in many children
    of narcissists. He can be submissive,  rebellious, or controlling. He
    fluctuates between his parents’ roles: his  submissive and victimized
    mother, his critical and domineering father. These  roles coexist with his
    compassion for people. Neither parent role is  acceptable. He victimizes
    himself by suppressing all activity. He is a crushing  tyrant who will not
    allow his life to progress, cannot have a lover or a wife,  cannot enjoy his
    work, will not seek out adventure. He is unable to shed his  baby fat and
    wallows in self-imposed misery.
</p>
<p>
    He victimizes others by  imposing his views upon them. Like his
    <a name="page116"></a>father, he  criticizes, demands, and gives unsolicited
    advice. His friends try to make him  understand how he sounds but he cannot
    hear them. The identification is still  too powerful. So they put up with
    his miserable intrusiveness because they love  the generous, compassionate,
    and self-sacrificing Nick who is one of the last  of the really true
    friends.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t overlook that he is  doing this to himself and deriving unconscious
    pleasure from his actions.  Behaving sadistically toward himself re-creates
    the bond with his narcissistic  father. Letting go of the sadomasochistic
    option would mean releasing his  father’s hand.
</p>
<p>
    All this is being challenged  in therapy. Nick is making slow progress,
    fanning the spark of his original  self. He takes two steps forward and one
    back, punishing himself for every step  toward autonomy with depression and
    despair, since growth represents disloyalty  to his hated and loved father.
    He speaks as if he hates his father, and in many  ways he does.
    Nevertheless, a childish wish for parental love keeps Nick  emotionally
    attached. In therapy Nick feels that he is making no progress at  all, but
    this is not true. It is only that life is going by at such a great  pace and
    his steps are so very small. Still, his overall apathy and numbness  have
    been converted into a recognizable depression. He knows that he lacks and
    that he needs. The depression will lift when he begins to try to meet these
    needs.

<p>
    In my meeting with Alan, our narcissistic problems interacted. A child  of a
    narcissist is frequently wed to the notion that he or she must be right  and
    the other wrong. That is how his parents acted, often putting him down and
    disregarding him. To the extent that he becomes fully narcissistic, he
    resembles them and they adulate his show of superiority. Fearing their
    interference, he develops the same defenses as they have, which include
    being  unable to accept views that differ from his own. If someone does not
    readily  defer to him, the child of a narcissist can get quite hot under the
    collar.  When his viewpoint <a name="page119"></a>is challenged, it is an
    enormous blow  and insult to his ego.
</p>
<p>
    If, like Alan, he is very  intelligent and well read, he buttresses what he
    says with scholarly  references, appearing to be in the know. He has
    differing views and acts  “right” to the other’s “wrong.” Here it concerned
    being the child of narcissistic  parents, a topic to which this interviewer
    has given considerable thought. As  the child of a narcissist, I am easily
    raised to ire by contact with a person  who acts my superior and will not
    listen. Alan’s treatment plummeted me back  into my submissive and inferior
    position with my father.
</p>
<p>
    This struggle, his and mine,  was a combination of arrogance and hurt
    feelings. Each wanted to be heard and  to be thought correct by the other. I
    was impressed by his endless references  and allusions, perhaps overly so
    since I was raised to worship “gray matter.” I  am interested in hearing
    contradictory views as long as the other person does  not disregard what I
    think. Alan chose to be the center of sound, an outpouring  of words that
    brooked no interruption. But I did not want to defer to his need  to be
    boss. I was upset by his attitude of self-important arrogance, having  been
    too often undercut intellectually as a child to be able to observe what he
    did from a point of neutrality. He clung to his image of superior
    understanding  and I demanded parity. The war was on.
</p>
<p>
    Children of narcissists pick  up their share of arrogance. We may not be
    fully narcissistic or we may. It is  to our benefit to track down our
    narcissism and get rid of it. Without  narcissism, we can be closer to other
    people, learn more, and suffer less.
</p>
<p>
    I arrived for the interview in an artificially  buoyed-up mood. My fear
    argued with the positive experiences I had been having  with all the other
    participants. I clung to the shaky assumption that  everything would go fine
    despite a plethora of evidence to the contrary.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page120"></a>I had  known Alan casually for a couple of years and
    emerged from most of our  conversations feeling intellectually inadequate.
    He induced this with a  constant string of scholarly references followed by
    the question, “Have you  read …?” which I hadn’t.
</p>
<p>
    Then he would go on and lose  me. What was he talking about? His thinking
    was crammed with information  tangential to the point, philosophical and
    literary asides, name-dropping of  specialized social movements. He was a
    master of quantity and speed. He talked  me deaf and dumb, filling the
    silent spaces I needed to breathe or think. The  distribution of talking and
    listening time was totally inequitable.
</p>
<p>
    He would use the few points I  feebly managed to splutter out as a
    jumping-off point for an ever greater  torrent of words. He used words and
    ideas to hide himself. He would dominate  our conversation with his own flow
    of speech. Quantity, obscurity, tangential  thinking, interpolated
    subthemes, any and every trick to confuse and lose the  listener. He didn’t
    want you to get too near him and didn’t want to be  understood.
</p>
<p>
    This was the man I was coming  to interview, hoping by dint of my office as
    interviewer to maintain control  over the situation. Little wonder I felt a
    degree of trepidation.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, it was not my  first interview and I had an idea of what I
    needed to know, having already  found amazingly repetitive patterns in many
    children of narcissists. These  patterns included such problems as
    paralyzing self-doubt, confusion about one’s  identity and goals, and
    oversensitivity to the opinions of others. Most of the  participants in the
    study felt they gained insight from our talking together.
</p>
<p>
    When I came in, Alan and I  embraced as near-friends. I was introduced to
    the baby-sitter, who was about to  take his little boy out for the
    afternoon. The child had large dark eyes and a  gentle manner. Noticing my
    amber necklace, he said, “Mommy has one just like  it.” Very observant
    child.
</p>
<p>
    After a brief house tour,  Alan invited me to have a bite to eat with him
    and we peered into an almost  empty refrigerator. There was hardly anything
    to eat, in the interest of  controlling his tendency to binge. I found a
    cold baked potato in tinfoil and  he had something congealing unattractively
    on a plate. With the crumbs and  remnants of our impoverished
    <a name="page121"></a>lunch before us, we sat down  to discuss the topic of
    narcissism.
</p>
<p>
    But first, he wanted to say  something about his son. He spoke in hushed
    tones of reverence. “He is  extremely bright.” Immediately, I felt a wave of
    depression. He repeated this  several times, giving various examples of his
    child’s brightness, including  fathoming events that he and his wife were
    trying to keep hidden. Or at least  he thought the child had. This measure
    of intelligence was tested by using an  indirect method of questioning, to
    be met by the child’s indirect method of  response. The level of his child’s
    understanding was assessed through  inference. I wondered if the father’s
    interest was in whether they had  protected the child from hurtful
    information or, more important to them,  whether their child was smart
    enough to figure it out.
</p>
<p>
    It was not the child’s  brightness that depressed me. It was Dad’s obsession
    with it. How he needed his  child to be brilliant. I knew this “intelligence
    sickness” from my own  childhood. In the blindness of repetition, Alan
    seemed unaware of spreading the  contagion and later asserted that he had
    freed himself of his parents’ demands  to be their genius. Now, it would
    appear, the demands came from within and  caused him to lower his child into
    the same quicksand.
</p>
<p>
    My depression was talking to  Alan in my head. It screamed things like:
    “Don’t pass on the tortured  suffering; leave off with expectations and
    evaluations. Set no conditions for  acceptance and don’t hold your breath
    every time he opens his mouth, hoping  that what emerges will be exceptional
    and fearing that it will be ordinary. He  senses what you are feeling. Even
    the adorable smile on his face may be an  attempt to please.” Of course, I
    said nothing.
</p>
<p>
    I said nothing because I  wanted Alan to present himself in a natural way; I
    didn’t want to undermine the  interview before its completion. There was
    already sufficient trouble between  us. I probably said little or nothing
    because he overwhelmed me with his  narcissistic guise of superiority, so
    similar to that of my father. I knew that  if I commented about his
    narcissistic treatment of his child it would hurt him  but not get through
    his blind spot and defenses.
</p>
<p>
    The psychological blind spot  is interesting territory. If the blind spot is
    yours, you cannot see through it  and you cannot see it. You can deduce your
    own blind spots through indirect  evidence but you have
    <a name="page122">
    </a>
    to be motivated to look for them.  Since his disease tells the narcissist
    that he is perfect, his blind spot is  the largest of all.
</p>
<p>
    Alan spoke of his child’s  artistic talent and how he would draw for hours.
    I felt his child being weighed  for units of specialness. Later, speaking of
    his own childhood, he said that he  was the family artist and “genius” who
    also “spontaneously” drew for long  periods. His parents kvelled (Yiddish
    for burst with  pride) and displayed his work. Alan now knows that his
    narcissistic father  needed him to replace the father’s dead brother, a man
    whose paintings covered  the walls of Alan’s childhood home. It was only
    later in the interview that I  heard Alan’s resentment at being used to
    replace a dead family member. Before  he expressed his feelings about being
    used, Alan had to maintain his assigned  role as stand-in artist/genius.
    Rembrandt was his chosen hero. Alan imagined  his own greatness taking a
    similar vein.
</p>
<p>
    Alan gave further background.  His parents came from Europe as “greenhorns.”
    His father needed to resurrect  through unconscious implantation the
    identities of two of his brothers and Alan  was the chosen recipient. The
    first was an artist and the second a man who  suffered a great deal and died
    young. Alan was to develop a talent for  suffering.
</p>
<p>
    I know the personal truth of  this. Alan is the kind of person you never
    want to greet with the customary  “How are you?” since Alan will tell you.
    He cannot resist the opportunity to  cry on your shoulder, which would be
    less annoying if he gave equal time to  your problems. But then most people
    would rarely want to speak that long. Alan  will hear them out, give a
    considered response, and then it is his turn.
</p>
<p>
    His ability to resonate with,  step up to, and feel universal pain is a
    benefit he uses in his craft (he is an  artist and writer), depicting the
    terrors and sufferings of other people. He  does this in visual art and
    words. His writing arouses one to tears for world  tragedy. He has taken the
    voices of minorities who never knew they had a  history and brought them
    into our awareness. He has presented the experience of  the war-torn. But in
    his personal life, intense self-involvement undercuts his  sensitivity to
    others. He demands sympathy and interest without awareness of  the other’s
    unstated response to him. He wants to see sympathy for him in your  eyes and
    tends not to notice your boredom, exhaustion, desire to speak, your
    resentment at being turned solely into a listener. His demandingness may
    allow  the unconscious release of hostility <a name="page123"></a>stored
    when his father  treated him the same way and made him into an unwilling
    audience.
</p>
<p>
    By choosing “morally correct”  topics to speak about, he can be a wolf in
    sheep’s clothing. “Morally correct”  topics show him to be a humanist and
    sympathizer with the underdog. Alan  actually feels this way but the way he
    speaks also carries the implicit  message: I will suffer and you must
    support my personal value by listening. He  runs with the ball of
    compassion, demanding indulgence to prove what a great  person he is for
    feeling so much.
</p>
<p>
    I returned from such musings  to the interview and started to pose a
    question. Alan cut me off. He had  already prepared some material showing
    his views of narcissism and of his  narcissistic parents. He is prone to
    cutting off the speaker.
</p>
<p>
    He started by telling a  dream. I will give it here in an uninterrupted
    rendition, although the telling  was broken up by innumerable digressions,
    and very nearly did not get told at  all by dint of our growing and
    unmanageable argument over the way he spoke. He  was drawing me along
    confusedly in his wake.
</p>
<p>
    “I was standing in a crowded  public square in an Italian town and spotted
    my mother in the distance. I  turned my back and ascended a few steps so
    that I could get a better view. When  she came up to me, she was very upset
    and accused me of turning my back to hurt  her in rejection. I attempted to
    explain that I didn’t mean to hurt her  feelings, that I was only trying to
    get a perspective.”
</p>
<p>
    This dream shows Alan  grappling with his hypersensitive and intrusive
    mother. He is attempting to get  above her and out of her invasive clutches.
    This dream explains our interaction  with each other. I too am an “invasive
    mommy” with my questions.
</p>
<p>
    Alan told me about his  mother. She was ambitious but educationally
    deprived, raised in a large and  poor family that couldn’t afford to keep
    her in school. She was proud of her son’s  artistic and academic
    achievements and wanted him to succeed but she didn’t  want him to be
    autonomous. He remembers her envy as he went off to his  scholarship
    classes, while she watched from the window as he left. He felt  guilty that
    he was relieved to be free of her.
</p>
<p>
    It is and was her need to get  through to him, to live inside him, that is
    disturbing. Both parents are  sufficiently narcissistic to remain
    <a name="page124"></a>fixed in their  defensive demands. He is currently
    less troubled by his father’s narcissistic  need to shape his personality.
    The damage has already been done and Alan is  inured. Alan’s radar is not
    set off by his father’s distant posturing. His own  regal mode keeps the
    proper distance. His mother’s need to get inside him is  less easily warded
    off.
</p>
<p>
    Alan started to explain his  parents’ narcissism by placing it in a
    historical context. Jews living in the  Polish-Russian shtetls had to learn
    to live as a symbiotic unit because they  were surrounded by hostile
    anti-Semitic peasants. The pattern of symbiosis entered  the Jewish culture
    and was subsequently exported to America.
</p>
<p>
    Alan experienced this  symbiosis in the second generation. He was tied to
    his family of greenhorns,  people who were ashamed of themselves and lived
    through his achievements. He  took his brown-bag lunch to the Ivy League
    campus where he was attending  classes on a scholarship. He took with him as
    well their feelings of  “nonbelonging” and inadequacy.
</p>
<p>
    I felt the need to make a  comment, to widen the understanding of
    narcissism. I was reacting to what  sounded like a rationalization, an
    explanation that covered up individual  motivation and responsibility. I
    said, “Shtetl life is not the only thing that  produces narcissism and
    symbiosis is not its only characteristic.” In nature,  symbiotes are
    mutually helpful. Narcissism is closer to parasitism. Symbiosis  lets us use
    each other, as we are two entities with mutually useful needs and  wants. We
    are rather interdependent. Narcissism allows me to use you as if I  exist in
    singular perfection and you are there to serve me. A narcissist feeds  on
    his children but his children do not receive reciprocal benefit.
</p>
<p>
    I said that narcissistic  parents wound their children by not loving them
    and that a lack of love was not  culturally ordained by the symbiosis of
    ghetto life. As an example of nonshtetl  narcissism, I spoke of Victoria,
    also discussed in this book. She is the child  of upper-middle-class WASPs,
    members of the dominant culture. Her narcissistic  mother hated her, but not
    because her mother was fleeing from her own societal  enemies.
</p>
<p>
    I was shocked when I received  the first wave of Alan’s fury. I had
    contradicted him! I was disputing his  knowledge of Jewish history. He
    started citing sociological texts and asking me  if I had read them. He
    <a name="page125"></a>announced that until I did, I was in  no position to
    conduct my study. He was trying to put me out of business.
</p>
<p>
    My mind began to lose its  focus, my usual response under such attack, a
    habitual response to my  narcissistic father’s invalidation of my thinking.
    I was no longer clear on  what I needed to ask him. The only thing I held on
    to was my need to have the  dream completed. I tried to change the subject
    by asking him to finish it. I  would put the pieces of the puzzle together
    later.
</p>
<p>
    This set off another tirade.  He wasn’t about to give me his dream. His
    tirade wasn’t over. I wasn’t getting  off that easy. He got angry, very
    angry, the words flying out of his mouth. He  went on and on about how I was
    invalidating his  knowledge. He had my back to the wall. I held on to my
    opinion (what else could  I do?), although I told him that I would consider
    his at my leisure. He  continued to fire the big guns and I now wonder why
    he was so threatened.
</p>
<p>
    The back-and-forth between us  only led to greater obstinate fury on his
    part. I feared that the point would  be reached where he would refuse to go
    on unless I apologized for my own  opinion and agreed with him one hundred
    percent. This I could not do. I was  experiencing the same feelings of
    invalidation I had as a small child when my  narcissistic father took
    umbrage over some imagined slight and cancelled me  out.
</p>
<p>
    I told him that I felt he was  trying to force an agreement from me when we
    had simply disagreed. He didn’t  see it like that and now he felt dismissed.
    I chided him like an exasperated  parent, which is how I felt: “Can’t we
    just get on with it?” I was trapped in  his child’s tantrum. This too
    annoyed him. He needed  to call the shots, not I. He would tell me when we
    could proceed. I was getting angrier. Alan was into his pain and he would
    not  let it go. In our interchange, both of us had the rage of a child with
    rejecting parents. In Alan’s adamant historical perspective, he avoided
    blaming  his father’s narcissism for undermining his shaky ego.
</p>
<p>
    Frankly, I do not know how we  resolved this. The storm just passed, perhaps
    due to some minor stirring of  guilt on his part. From my perspective, his
    explanation of the shtetl origin of  narcissism was important to him because
    of his pride in his knowledge of Jewish  history and his ability to do a
    historical-psychological analysis, wedded <a name="page126"></a>to
    narcissistic hypersensitivity over any implication that his  thinking was
    not flawless. Additionally, the shtetl explanation, by focusing on
    symbiosis, lessened his awareness of the destructiveness of his father’s
    narcissism. Having joined his father in like defense, it is safer to leave
    it  alone. Symbiosis was the primary hurtful characteristic of Alan’s
    mother.
</p>
<p>
    Symbiosis does not a  narcissist make. The true narcissist lives in
    grandiose isolation and  manipulates rather than experience his dependency
    on other people, as does  Alan’s father, as does Alan himself. Symbiosis is
    an easy target which allows  Alan to dodge guilt by association as he walks
    in his father’s footprints.
</p>
<p>
    He had some kind of breakdown  as a young man running after his parents’
    acceptance and afterward vowed “not  to need to please anybody through my
    achievements.” He would be content within  himself, utterly self-contained
    and self-satisfied through his artistic output.  This is why his mother’s
    attempts to penetrate his shield of grandiosity, to be  close to him and
    share his glory, are unacceptable.
</p>
<p>
    Alan had had some therapy but  the surface was barely scratched when his
    therapist died. Narcissists can be in  therapy many years before they
    change, before they can listen to a  contradictory opinion. They may require
    endless hours of being listened to and  of receiving absolute support. The
    therapist must be perceived as taking their  side against an insensitive
    world. Only after years of building trust will the  narcissistic person
    admit to dependency on the therapist and only then will a  conflicting
    viewpoint be considered.
</p>
<p>
    Nothing I said to Alan was  absorbed or accepted. As far as my interviewing
    techniques were concerned, it  was a total rout. My attempts to shape the
    interview were taken as an attack  upon him, his autonomy, thought patterns,
    the value of his essential being. We  both lost our tempers when I tried to
    force him to answer questions and not to  overwhelm me with words.
</p>
<p>
    The clock said it was time to  leave, although nothing had been completed.
    We stood up in disarray and made  one more attempt to reach each other but
    the same subjectivity poisoned our  communication. Alan told me with
    annoyance that he had given up valuable time  to see me that he needed for
    his own work. He said that he had always felt the  tension between us and
    was trying to make it better. I felt guilty <a name="page127"></a>but
    thought, “My time is also valuable and much of it was  wasted listening to
    your defensive perorations.”
</p>
<p>
    I saw in him my utterly  inaccessible narcissistic father, who is never
    wrong. And he saw in me his  overly sensitive, intrusive mother pursuing him
    up the steps. My assertiveness  and insistence on having my own place in our
    interview were regarded as  intrusive. This is to be expected of a
    narcissist. As the child of a  brains-oriented narcissist, I was
    hypersensitive to his overtalking and  position of superiority and responded
    very negatively to the mistreatment of  not being listened to.
</p>
<p>
    We had run out of time. I had  to go. On the way to the door, Alan spoke
    ruefully, in the tone of suffering  sainthood. “What goes wrong between us?”
    I was annoyed at his tone and still  holding on to the illusion that truth
    could help. I said, “It’s because you’re  too long-winded for me.”
</p>
<p>
    Another flare-up. What a fool  I was. His eyes were filled with fire, his
    eyebrows raised in contempt. “People  tell me that,” he said, “but I am a
    man of passion.” His implication was that  they are all wrong. “I am a
    deeply related person. I care about issues.”  “Deeply related to your own
    self,” I thought.
</p>
<p>
    I felt totally defeated by  myself and by him. Alan went on and on. He had
    no concept of time. Desperate to  end on a conciliatory note, I apologized
    and said that I was hypersensitive to  verbosity because my family had
    abused my listening. I asked him to consider it  as my shortcoming, a
    sufficiently neutral and self-abnegating statement that he  could hear. He
    said, “Next time, please let me know when I have exceeded your  limit.” This
    was a better ending. We were not parting as enemies.
</p>
<p>
    We hugged good-bye sadly  outside, standing in front of my car. Truly
    exhausting.
</p>
<p>
    I emerged from this interview  shaken, angry, and confused, guilty about my
    contribution to the anger between  us, my own lack of flexibility, and
    hypersensitivity. We each had stepped on  the other’s narcissistic toes. I
    wondered what the people who knew us would  think if they heard our
    interchange. As for myself, a good deal of time had  been spent learning
    very little. I regarded the meeting as a total loss.
</p>
<p>
    I was so discouraged that I  was ready to scrap the whole thing
    <a name="page128"></a>when I realized that the  problems of our interaction
    said a lot about our narcissism.
</p>
<p>
    This was the first person I  had interviewed whose narcissism was so great
    as to require total protection  from a foreign idea or voice. His narcissism
    had been somewhat rearranged and  concealed by a facade of therapized
    rationalization. But it still was classic.  Our exaggerated conflicts
    expressed many narcissistic problems. As Marshall  McLuhan said, “The medium
    is the message.”

</h1>
<p>
    Children of narcissists are subjected to parental abuse that they come  to
    associate with love. The parent attacks not only what they do but who they
    are. Hearing not “That is wrong,” but “You are stupid” affects their sense
    of  self. As a result, the child needs to hide who he is and develops
    defenses  toward that end.
</p>
<p>
    Fat can serve this purpose. A  parent can attack you for being fat, which is
    glaring and obvious. Behind this  defense you can hide your talent, dreams,
    and wishes, the things that are  uniquely you. Your parent is distracted by
    the fat and doesn’t reach for deeper  places within you that you want to
    <a name="page131"></a>keep untouched. You also  stay fat because you want
    your parent’s love and fear his or her displeasure at  your having an
    independent life. Obesity often makes a person unpopular with  the opposite
    sex. Eating is a permissible pleasure that can get out of hand  since it
    comforts you and removes your attention from troubled thoughts.  Overeating
    is a problem for several of the people in this book. For Nick,  Marie, Alan,
    and Victoria, it has led to obesity. Obesity is commonly defined  as being
    about 10 percent above the average weight for your height and build.
    Obesity is often associated with reduced physical activity, fatigue, and
    ultimately with damaged health. For Marie, weight change is periodic.
</p>
<p>
    People often speak of dieting  without recognizing that fat is but a surface
    symptom. You can take off the fat  but if you leave the problems that fester
    underneath, it will come back. Or  instead of fat you will develop another
    defense that expresses the same  problems and equally covers your interior.
    If you still need to flee your problems,  you may turn to such escapes as
    drugs or compulsive overwork. If you want to  appear bigger than you are and
    have a child’s view of adulthood, you may  develop a loud voice and
    imperious manner. If you want to conceal your  sexuality, you may dress in a
    fashion that declares you neuter, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, some infants are  raised to overeat and thereby develop extra fat
    cells at an early age that  later predispose them to being overweight. As
    adults, they more easily gain  weight than other people at the same caloric
    level. However, with an exercise  program and appropriate diet, it is hard
    to remain overweight.
</p>
<p>
    After years of therapy, Marie  still disowns what drives her to eat. She
    knows she dislikes herself but  attributes that to the action of an outside
    agent. Fatness keeps her single and  postpones a sensual life. We must own
    our self-hatred if we are to deal with  it. To love ourselves and seek
    outside love is a mighty struggle. If we avoid  this undertaking, we will
    have only the limited love of our narcissistic  parents.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page132"></a>Marie is a unique being.  From the outset, she wanted
    to help and was open and willing to expose the  problems of being the child
    of a narcissist. On our first call, I was struck by  something in her voice,
    a certain tone. Although her message was hearty, I  thought I heard an
    undercurrent of fear. I wondered if she knew of this and  looked forward to
    our talk.
</p>
<p>
    The woman who greets me is  very fat, 212 pounds at 5’1”. She is large in
    every dimension, like a full,  ripe fruit, and not unattractive. She laughs
    easily and is full of energy. Her  alert expression radiates intelligence.
    She tells me that she was not always  full of life and raring to go. Therapy
    is restoring the “happy kid” she was  before being caught in the vise of her
    mother’s narcissism.
</p>
<p>
    Marie grew up in Bulgaria, a  country racked by insurrection, where her
    father was a peripatetic engineer who  worked in far-off places and was
    largely absent during her first five years.  She and her mother lived in a
    city far from the sites of insurrection. Mother  frequently joined him,
    leaving Marie in the countryside with her doting  maternal grandparents and
    uncle. She was only eight months old the first time  mother dropped her off
    with her grandparents. The visit was only supposed to  last the weekend, but
    extended into an incredible six months.
</p>
<p>
    Her mother’s needs did not  center around the infant and her later
    “weekends” often extended to a second  week. A base party to attend, a
    missed bus, and it was midweek, not worth  coming home for a day or two
    before returning. Marie was happy with her  grandparents, who were her
    caretakers. Later this relationship gave her  distance from a mother who
    wanted total control and would withdraw emotional  support to enforce her
    will. Marie could resist since her support lay elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
    Her grandparents cared for  her when her mother could not handle the child’s
    illnesses or did not wish to.  Mother was panicked by every city health
    scare and within hours, Marie was  packed and standing at the corner waiting
    for a taxi to take her to them. She  never knew where she would lay her head
    that night and which school she would  attend in the morning. There was
    little security.
</p>
<p>
    Her grandfather was an  Orthodox priest who would come home from a wedding
    or christening, pockets  stuffed with sugared almonds. He would freeze in
    the doorway and Marie would  throw herself on him <a name="page133"></a>to
    search his pockets. She was utterly  indulged by him and her uncle, who also
    loved to play. Her greatest losses were  when her uncle left to be married
    and her grandfather died.
</p>
<p>
    She was so much their  favorite that during adolescence, when she and a
    cousin visited in their  miniskirts (Marie was thin at the time), the cousin
    had to sit with a towel  covering her thighs while Marie was accepted as she
    was. “With them, I could do  no wrong.” They helped Marie to develop her
    self but she always feared that  what she had could be taken away. An
    example of this was in her grandparents’  encouraging her to sing and dance.
    At the age of three and a half, she was an  uninhibited little performer.
    When her mother heard her lovely voice, she got  Marie booked on the local
    radio station.
</p>
<p>
    Marie did not know of her  right to say no and went to the station in a
    state of terror. She heard her  mother’s boastful introduction and then was
    “on,” another lesson in  surrendering her will. Lack of control is normal
    for a three-year-old but this  became her attitude for life. She was the
    property of her mother, a woman who  could dispose of her child’s mind and
    body.
</p>
<p>
    And criticize. It started  with her body. First she was “too thin” and dosed
    with cod liver oil, shots,  and vitamins to fatten her up. Then she overshot
    the mark and became “too fat,”  to be put on an endless series of diets. She
    was the wrong height and wrong  weight. When the body is labeled inadequate,
    the self feels analogously  diminished. Even though Marie is forty-one, her
    mother still asks her if she  has grown taller to offset her rotundity.
</p>
<p>
    She fought back and would not  kowtow. The self her grandparents had
    nurtured was more than her mother had  bargained for. It responded even when
    she was terrified. She challenged her  mother’s statements. Her mother would
    call her fat and she would answer  cockily, “You’re not so slim yourself.”
    Her mother would call her friendless  and Marie would ask, “So where are
    your friends?”  which was met with a slap in the face. Marie fended off
    criticisms and believed  them, every one. She was fat—and relatively
    friendless.
</p>
<p>
    The latter problem arose from  being three years younger than her
    classmates. Her ambitious mother entered her  into the first grade a year
    early by changing the year of her birth. Since the  month of Marie’s
    birthday fell right before the cut-off date, she was  immediately ahead
    <a name="page134"></a>by two years and when she skipped a  grade, by three.
    In the sixth grade, she was nine among twelve-year-olds,  mentally
    precocious but emotionally and physically immature. The other children  felt
    it and cut her out of their social activities. Marie suffered a great deal
    from loneliness and struck up a friendship with a girl three grades down.
    This  was brought to the attention of the guidance counselor, who was
    concerned that  Marie seemed to be socially retarded and sent for her
    mother. Not only did her  mother not reveal her child’s true age, but later
    bawled her out for playing  with a younger child!
</p>
<p>
    Her mother saw no mistake or  hardship in forcing Marie to get along with
    children who were more mature.  Narcissists do not make mistakes. There was
    something wrong with Marie for not  being able to do so. Marie had to go
    along with a denial of her real age and of  the propriety of her emotional
    needs.
</p>
<p>
    Her father reentered the  household when she was five. He was puritanical
    and shunned overt physicality.  The only place for embracing was at the
    airport when saying farewell. If Marie  threw herself on him at the wrong
    time (probably a carryover from her life with  her grandparents), he would
    say, “You’re mushy,” get up, and leave the room.  She would be rewarded by
    his company if she was a “pure head” and sexless  know-it-all. Marie was
    into endless reading and pursuit of every fact. She was  determined to know
    it all.
</p>
<p>
    Her father took teenage Marie  to a movie. When he caught sight of some sex
    in The Prime of  Miss Jean Brodie, he walked out and she remained. Later, he
    told her, “I  would have thought better of you.” Her interest in sexuality
    was condemned by  him as wrong. This was not what she had felt with her
    grandparents.
</p>
<p>
    To adapt, she denied her body  by getting fatter. Her possum act was “Fat is
    dead.” Strong sensual feelings,  condoned by her grandparents and flowing
    beneath the surface, would not be  suspected by her father, who condemned
    them, or by her mother, who thought her  daughter’s sexuality competitive.
    Marie was very much alive and her gross body  was a ruse that made her seem
    maternal, asexual, and safe. She felt superior in  her self-abnegation. Her
    father preferred this brainy daughter to his fleshy,  sensual, and emotional
    wife, who didn’t read. Her mother preferred this  know-it-all daughter to
    her demanding younger children. Marie was on a family pedestal  as goddess
    of intellect <a name="page135"></a>and substitute mother with younger
    siblings. As her family’s intellectual totem, she was praised as
    compensation  for being suppressed and used. Her feelings rebelled against
    this and when she  looked within, her feelings called her a dismal failure.
</p>
<p>
    Her shape and eating habits  were public property. She was not in charge, a
    common experience for one who  becomes obese. Others must control this
    person’s eating because she lacks the  strength and will never acquire
    discipline. Marie said, “my body felt  humiliated.” Wrongness was painted on
    by her mother’s disgust. Her self watched  from a distance, a split
    reinforced by violence. Mother hit her around the face  and head, slapped
    and beat her. She lived in constant fear of attack. Fat was a  lightning rod
    for her mother’s rage. She had “a lot of pain around the heart”  which her
    detached head did not understand.
</p>
<p>
    Shifting back and forth  between her grandparents and her mother gave her
    two different self-images. Her  grandparents found her absolutely perfect.
    They were physically demonstrative,  encouraged play, sensual enjoyment, and
    pleasure. Her mother opposed this. If  there was an argument with her mother
    and her mother’s thinking was found to be  incorrect, Mother would switch
    sides and say that Marie’s view had been the  wrong one. Such “crazy-making”
    (Marie’s expression) pried her loose from  reality. It was hard to know who
    had said what. Crazy-making was there when her  mother asked questions
    without listening to the answers. Marie took this as  evidence of her own
    inadequacy.
</p>
<p>
    Her life was filled with  surrender and resistance. She had stopped singing
    and dancing. “Singing was the  most difficult thing for me to do.” She was
    an intellectual who read any book  whose title was mentioned, too insecure
    not to know what another person knew.  Her quest for education brought her
    to graduate school in the United States,  and the fatness that concealed her
    came along. Once here, she started dropping  weight at an amazing rate and
    came down to 132 pounds, size six. Being  “large-boned,” she was thin. She
    felt that being thin brought public notice to  her sexual availability. She
    was declaring her womanhood.
</p>
<p>
    But her unconscious mind  needed to win her mother’s love, so the man she
    chose to be with was  narcissistic. He needed someone to live through and
    hobble down. As soon as  they met, she started losing ground. Her feelings
    must have been in a state of  alarm but the child of a narcissist does not
    properly read inner signals and an  obese person <a name="page136"></a>is
    even less in touch. When he asked for a  date, the talking head said, “Why
    not?” There was no logical reason not to.  After they dated for a while, he
    asked her to live with him. “Why not,” she  thought and they did. When he
    said that they should marry, she said, “Why not” and  never felt a thing.
</p>
<p>
    Her husband was not only  narcissistic but was like her father in that he
    suppressed erotic expression.  At a party, he would allot himself one dance
    as “enough.” Sex happened once a  month. Her sensuality was controlled. A
    year after marriage, she was over three  hundred pounds. Eating covered
    agony. She was back in hiding, again  anesthetized and compliant. Her
    husband did not mind his wife’s overweight,  which represented the security
    of her shackles. They had children, and she gave  herself to mothering. Her
    children had enough attention and a decade went by.  Marie was established
    in her career as a teacher and the children were doing  well. She got into
    therapy and saw the importance of her grandparents, who had  kept her from
    madness. It had been easier to forget them and adapt to misery by  assuming
    that everyone’s mother was like her own. Her grandparents’ love became  a
    standard of light against which she could measure her parents’ darkness.
</p>
<p>
    Marie hated being captive to  marriage and began to chafe at its
    constraints. She was ready for divorce  despite her husband’s unhappiness
    over the loss of one who had provided for his  needs for years. Even her
    friends had become his. Not wanting to hurt him, she  waited until he found
    a lady friend so that he could let go of her more easily.  Then she was
    alone.
</p>
<p>
    Although she lives a  continent away, there is still the telephone and her
    mother’s opinion. Of  course her mother called her a failure for divorcing.
    Marie feels increasingly  disconnected from her mother, who is “getting
    smaller and smaller.” She thinks  that her mother, who is in her late
    seventies, is withdrawing in the detachment  of age and not needing Marie as
    much as she used to. She mentions how her  sister provides endless caring
    and is so afraid of Mother’s death that she  keeps her mother dressed in
    childish pink. The sister, who is younger than  Marie, has no outside sexual
    love relations. Her life is devoted to the  architectural profession in
    which her mother takes pride, and then to Mother herself.
</p>
<p>
    Mother is not suffering from  any particular illness except a general
    <a name="page137"></a>wearing down.  Still, I think that Marie’s opinion
    about her mother’s lack of need is wrong,  although it may not be turned to
    Marie. Narcissists do not change much with the  years except to get
    depressed if their vanity is not supported. “It looks as if  your mother is
    using your sister the way she once used you.”
</p>
<p>
    Marie says that she is not  out of the picture. She helps her mother deal
    with issues that her sister  cannot face, information that will make it
    easier for Mother to die. Her sister  dresses their mother in pink and tries
    to deny the inevitable. I ask if Marie  feels that her mother appreciates
    her efforts. “Oh, no. Mother metabolizes the  information and then comes
    back for more.”
</p>
<p>
    She says that she is able to  let her mother pass away. But it feels to me
    as if she is jumping over work  that still needs to be done. Obese people
    often use denial, like eating, to  deny inner pain. Marie may be relatively
    free of her outer mother, but what of  the inner?
</p>
<p>
    “Why are you still  overweight?” She becomes quiet, then answers, “It is an
    area of conflict,” and  “I am still full of self-hate.” “Men find me
    attractive but I am unable to take  the message in.” She holds on to her
    mother’s view of her body and self, to her  father’s opinion about not
    showing sexuality to men, who will think her “too  much” in passion, energy,
    and sensuality. She says she knows that her body has  “a certain sweetness
    about it” but mutes its signal. No sexual signs from her  unless the man
    declares his interest. Fatness is her disguise.
</p>
<p>
    “Why do you hold on to these  negative ideas?” I am amazed at the tenacity
    of suffering. After a pause she  says, “Sometimes when I meditate, negative
    ideas come to me from the outside,  as if they had a life of their own.” She
    cites a book by a Cypriot mystic who  felt that if you hold on to an
    introject for a long time, it starts to exist  outside of you and to have
    power. The writer claims to see his introject as a  kind of cloud. With this
    mystical explanation, Marie rejects the necessity for  confronting herself.
    She avoids seeing that she clings to a way of life that  shields her from
    taking responsibility for the attacks of and rejection by her  negative
    inner parent.
</p>
<p>
    I argue against the external  existence of this introject with its own
    power. I say that we are the source of  its power and that we can be mired
    in self-hatred if we don’t take  responsibility for the contents of our
    mind. Once Marie anesthetized herself to  her emotional pain by
    <a name="page138"></a>acting on the basis of logic alone.  Then she thought
    to diminish further attack by adding the cover of fat. But the  negative
    introject was already in residence.
</p>
<p>
    Although the negative  introject feels foreign to all of us, we can
    eliminate it by admitting to and  understanding its presence. To give it a
    life outside of ourselves is to court  madness. Then we feel possessed and
    in need of exorcism. We do not see our need  for control of the attacking
    thought as an internal fight. I speak of this to  Marie and she says that
    she fears to be her “higher self,” and “on my own.” “I  am ashamed of that.”
    The child of a narcissist is raised to feel guilty for  desiring
    independence. Fat connects her with her mother. Living her mother’s  recipe
    for failure makes her mother correct: “You are ungainly, and sexually
    unpopular.” A fat, humiliated person shrinks out of sight. Fat is like an
    armored car, battened against attack. Fat is like a weight that pulls her
    down.
</p>
<p>
    Why the tone of fear in her  voice? She lives in fear of rejection for being
    a full person. I believe that  Marie will divest herself of the harsh inner
    parent only by attaining normal  weight. I think this because being slim is
    her statement of freedom. When we  live the defensive life, our energy is
    tied up in defensive structures and we  cannot know the self. To know who we
    are we need to come out from behind the  barricade and enter the light.
</p>
<p>
    Therapy can help Marie do  this, but she has already been in therapy for
    years. Intellectual understanding  needs to be lived to become a part of our
    sense of self. As long as she remains  obese, she can believe that if she
    assumes her proper weight it would drive men  away as once it did her dad.
    As it was with Mom, she can believe that all love  depends on sacrifice.
    Weight protects her from having an experience of what  life could offer if
    she were to accept herself.

</h1>
<p>
    Mark’s narcissistic and controlling mother arrested the development of  his
    psychological strength. He battled but usually ended in submission to her
    injured state of mind. In their household his mother had her way. She issued
    the law, which her husband and son followed. Mark’s father was distant and
    submissive, a man who offered a poor model of assertiveness. His hobby was
    cooking. <a name="page141"></a>He hid behind the pots while his wife set the
    scene.
</p>
<p>
    Mark was distracted by his  mother’s intrusiveness and accepted her doubtful
    view of him to the point where  his self-esteem was undermined. He wanted to
    please her and still be free,  contradictory motivations that subverted his
    concentration. His school record  was doubtful and he was unsure if there
    was any possibility of academic  success.
</p>
<p>
    Instead of facing his fears  and doubts, he adopted the “manly” skills of
    running, hiking, and camping and  became an Eagle Scout. Lanky, tall, and
    powerful, this man of muscle swam like  a fish, went scuba diving, canoed,
    went camping, and could survive most natural  things. However, his mother’s
    narcissistic machinations were not natural.
</p>
<p>
    To quell self-doubt, Mark  does things that other people would find
    extremely difficult, like swimming in  an icy lake while others watch; like
    camping in a snowbound tent in which he  stows the ax brought to chop
    firewood. In his ordinary life he rides a  motorcycle through the madness of
    a city. In all these heroic moments he  asserts his worth, and by acting
    carefree and self-confident he almost  convinces himself. If anyone were to
    ask Mark if he felt sufficiently manly and  he gave an honest answer, it
    would be no. Instead of facing his feelings of  inadequacy, he has become
    physically stronger and functions only partially at  developing a career.
</p>
<p>
    He married a woman who would  ride behind him on his motorcycle, although in
    later years she declined. They  had a child, in large part because he needed
    to present a manly image by having  an offspring. What particularly affected
    the child was Mark’s need that the  child be extremely strong from birth.
    Mark thought that such a need was  delightful fun for his child and could
    not see his true response. In this  relationship, we see how narcissistic
    problems are passed on.
</p>
<p>
    Mark is a friend of mine from California, a  former Eagle Scout who does not
    pay attention to his young son Bruce’s  vulnerability. Bruce was
    <a name="page142"></a>in his second year when I visited  them and saw Mark
    let his child move toward an obvious accident in which he  fell down part of
    a flight of stairs. The boy had been standing halfway down  the stairs, to
    which his father paid no attention. He lost his balance and  tumbled to a
    hard landing, where he lay and did not emit a sound.
</p>
<p>
    Mark walked over, picked  Bruce up for a quick once-over, and found nothing
    significantly wrong. He  seemed unable to respond emotionally to his child’s
    feelings and to the child’s  body. His response was as to a machine, a human
    machine that he hadn’t kept  from personal injury. He held the child with
    insufficient affection, as if he  were an object. Finding no bruises, he
    gave Bruce a pat of reassurance, set him  on his feet, and walked away.
</p>
<p>
    There was not a word between  them. I watched in horror as it happened,
    noting that the fallen child barely  whimpered. This was not a childproof
    house and he was used to taking bruises in  response to his father’s need
    for a two-year-old Eagle Scout. Although a  good-natured person, Mark had a
    narrowness of perception that made him unaware.  He is partly narcissistic
    in that personal ambition shapes his behavior and  makes him unable to
    understand his child. He is filled with compulsive needs  that his child
    must fill, a controlling approach not unlike the way his  narcissistic
    mother treated him. He does not think of his child’s feelings when  his own
    important wishes are concerned. Heroic needs rule his perceptions and
    demands. The child’s injuries had but a moment of attention. The child gets
    little emotional contact, as if he were a hamster running in its cage. It is
    as  if Mark feels there is no way to be at one with his child.
</p>
<p>
    When Bruce was about three,  he and his parents visited me. Again he seemed
    to be in constant danger. This  time he nearly fell into a nearby creek. He
    did not act like an ordinary child,  who would have tested before making his
    move. He was in constant motion, like  an outlet for the dynamic energy of a
    battery that is always on. He was like a  wild animal with drugged senses,
    on the run out of fear and unable to test its  surroundings.
</p>
<p>
    Bruce did not heed our calls  nor answer to his name. The way he acted made
    me feel sad and frightened. I  thought the child to be seriously
    unreachable. His mother watched his dangerous  perambulations and took me
    aside to complain that her husband put Bruce into <a
    name="page143"></a>dangerous situations and took insufficient care. She said
    that  Mark scolded and disobeyed her when she asked him not to do it.
    Despite her  anxiety, Mark’s need and vision ruled the treatment of their
    child. Although  she said that she nagged Mark about this, I found her
    willingness to accept a  dangerous situation for her child a peculiar kind
    of diffidence. Perhaps a  driven man like Mark had done well to marry a
    woman who looked at issues from  afar. It kept their point of conflict from
    generating into open warfare.
</p>
<p>
    That night, the child  wandered aimlessly and frenetically from room to
    room, unrelated to the  grownups who were talking. He was without rest but
    his parents did not try to  put him to bed. It disturbed me that we could
    not reach him. His parents found  him difficult but did not label him as
    emotionally out of contact. They threatened  jokingly to leave him asleep in
    his stroller, left parked in my kitchen, so  they could depart on the sly. I
    believe that his mother had conceived the baby  to please her husband and
    never fully cottoned to a motherly role.
</p>
<p>
    I could not get Bruce into my  lap for a snuggle. One time, I grabbed him as
    he went by, held on to find him  in a reaction stiff and distant. What
    happens to a child’s need for contact if  his deprivation is broken into
    only for a brief hug and then he is returned to  Nowhere Land? What happens
    if he is disregarded by parents who remain out of  touch and use him to
    fulfill their fantasies? Rather than having momentary  respite from
    loneliness, it is better to live like a tank at war. The pain of  feeling on
    and off again is more horrible than going without feeling and  contact
    altogether.
</p>
<p>
    He did not respond to  physical contact and a friendly voice. As the night
    wore on, I eventually  coaxed him out of his troubled walking into a nap on
    the cushion that lay by my  side. I patted it and made soothing sounds to
    which he settled in. But he  rested without being touched and kept a
    frightened distance. This was not a  child who wanted to be held.
</p>
<p>
    Two years later, when the  child was five, I saw the three of them again.
    Bruce was like a wooden Indian who,  at Mark’s command, swung over his
    father’s arm like a top, arms fixed at his  side, face and eyes
    inexpressive. I barely heard him speak although he later  played
    mechanically with the phone. Again, I grabbed him for a hug when he  would
    not talk and found his body unyielding as a nail. He was without social
    contact, raised to be a “superman” by a father who needed to see
    <a name="page144"></a>his own image reflected in a tough, unfeeling person.
    One day  his child would be an Eagle Scout. But what would be the child’s
    inner life?
</p>
<p>
    A child wants to please his  parents. If they are narcissistic and tell him
    how to feel, he stops knowing  his own feelings. A narcissistic parent
    declares his child’s natural feelings  wrong if they are in disagreement
    with his own, if they fall short of the  parent’s image, are critical of the
    parent, or express a contrary notion. The  narcissistic parent wants to be
    beyond criticism, to be mirrored as a god. The  obedient child surrenders
    his own awareness.
</p>
<p>
    This child disengages from  his rejected feeling self. If his narcissistic
    parent projects horrifying and  unacceptable feelings onto him, these are
    what he feels. If he is treated as  unloving and unlovable but able to show
    physical heroics, that is what he will  be and do. A love-hungry child goes
    dead inside, an enactment that implies, “I  am without love and tough as my
    parents need me to be.” To please them, he is  in accord with their need.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, you cannot  definitively predict the adult future of a
    five-year-old. I imagine that he  will do many things to show how tough he
    is. He will enjoy camping, swimming,  skiing, the deeds his father likes to
    share. I think he will not get close to  people. Closeness does not
    naturally develop late. Without help in getting to  know himself, probably
    from psychotherapy, he will go through life at a  distance, not wanting to
    know the horrors of his need for affection,  understanding, and the
    knowledge of an unmet self. If feelings of his unfilled  need for love get
    through to him, he will feel depression and possibly engage  in
    self-destructive activity. Childhood did not teach him that such needs can
    be met. Psychotherapy would be in order.

<p>
    Children of narcissists can grow from weakness into strength. In order  to
    do so, we must know things inside us that hold us back, and we must change
    them. The work of change develops strengths that go well beyond the usual.
    “Usual” means falling in line with the average norms of society. Life with a
    narcissistic parent always means fitting in with his or her schema. Instead
    we  need to find our unique opinion. We need perseverance to overcome the
    problem  of self-unknowing. In this chapter we look at our specific
    problems, ways to  approach them, and the strengths that we need to develop.
</p>
<p>
    To change, we must know the  biases that we hold against our
    <a name="page147"></a>selves. What did our  parents hate and love in us and
    how much did these judgments define our  self-images? We may have learned
    our parents’ values but our history is  difficult to fathom since these
    anti-self attitudes are ancient and appear in  everything we do. We are like
    bonsai plants with prior years of confinements,  suppression, and reshaping.
    What is our natural shape? It takes years to  uncover as we revert by
    degrees to growing.
</p>
<p>
    Take the following example of  a learned error: A narcissistic father had
    opera lessons in his youth. As a  parent, he often broke into stentorian
    measures of an opera, his favorite being  “La Donna e mobile” (Woman is
    fickle), whose words  expressed mistrust of the faithfulness of women
    everywhere. From her earliest  years, he nagged his daughter about being out
    of tune. He would encourage her  to sing a few notes and then would commence
    with the evaluation. He spoke in  tones full of scorn and amazement, sang
    his correction, and jeeringly provoked  her to continue. She stopped singing
    and retreated into humiliated silence. Had  she been out of tune? Probably.
    Attacked as she was, her incapacity was  permanently instilled.
</p>
<p>
    She accepted the diagnosis of  being incapable of carrying a tune and lost
    contact with her voice. She was a  stranger to what came out of her mouth.
    She could hear another person’s singing  pitch and could tell the difference
    between notes that were closely spaced, but  when she had to sing, she
    couldn’t, not even “Happy birthday to you.” Her  throat did not respond to
    her ears. Perhaps she did not hear herself because  embarrassment was with
    her and always ran the show.
</p>
<p>
    Singing in tune came of  itself after years of psychotherapy with a
    therapist who had perfect pitch and  could test her. She had not worked on
    singing, but with better knowledge of  what she thought and felt she began
    to control her singing notes. Without a  critical listener to mock what she
    produced, her attention was less divided.  She was not so easily dissuaded
    from her perceptions and regained her voice as  a sign of self-knowledge.
    Being disunited from self is a problem for the child  of a narcissist. I
    wonder how many cannot sing in tune.
</p>
<p>
    It helps to know how you feel  about your life. Although self-blame makes us
    blind, if we ask ourselves what  happened to us in childhood and from this
    who we really are, images will come.  Some of them are
    <a name="page148">
    </a>
    painful but less painful than living an  unrecognized image, a fate
    predicted and thus determined by the parent.
</p>
<p>
    You can listen to your inner  self by allowing a fantasy that tells you what
    once was. I remember being  inducted into a past-life regression by a woman
    who did such work as I lay on  the floor and followed instructions. I have
    no belief in past life but had the  fantasy of being a desert slave who
    slept on a bed of corn husks stacked in a  slatted bin. I was a slave in
    both sexes for three generations, always sleeping  in that bin and
    increasingly disgusted till I walked into the starry desert  night to
    escape. I walked so far that the settlement became a whispering of  lights
    on the horizon but I found nothing to walk to. Rather than die out there
    alone I walked back.
</p>
<p>
    This was not a past life  experience. It was a metaphor for my life
    experience with narcissistic parents,  slaving for the smallest bits of
    approval.
</p>
<p>
    Some children of narcissists  act as badly as their parents say they do, and
    even if they do something well,  these children focus on all evidence that
    might support their parents’ negative  view. Although my secret desire was
    to become a dancer, I was described by my  narcissistic parent as a klutz
    and never dared ask for lessons.
</p>
<p>
    Klutz I was when I served ice  cream to my narcissistic parent’s girlfriend
    and to her friend Sabine, a  visitor from Michigan. I decided to balance the
    dish of ice cream on top of her  head and somehow spilled it on her dress.
    It was horrible, wiping ice cream off  and feeling utterly clumsy as my
    father’s hateful comments echoed round. My  error proved him right. Better
    for me to hide.
</p>
<p>
    Did you learn self-hatred?  What negatives were laid upon you that entered
    into your self-image? Do you  have self-condemnatory physical, mental,
    spiritual views? Are the views based  on something real or were they told
    and retold until you believed them? Do you  believe things about yourself
    that no one has seen, but you cannot be  dissuaded? Do you feel yourself to
    be in an objectionable state?
</p>
<p>
    Shaped by the forced  absorption of our parent’s opinion, we are like hungry
    frogs whose tongues dart  out for the passing fly. Unlike a frog, we will
    eat poisonous flies, poisonous  comments that make us feel great or
    inadequate, distorting messages that reject  us as we are. We
    <a name="page149"></a>feel so unacceptable that if something bad  is said
    about us, we ingest its substance. We do not discard incorrect  opinions,
    especially those put forth by the narcissistic parent. We need to  learn to
    judge information about ourselves and to discard what is wrong.
</p>
<p>
    What experiences verified  your parents’ negative view of you? I was eleven
    and at camp. It was a “work  camp” attended by creative kids, a place where
    we could spend the entire day at  what we liked without having to compete at
    such activities as volleyball. We  could garden on the farm and watch a cow
    give birth. Almost everyone went to  calf birth. We could dance or play in
    the orchestra. There were even sports.  For me it was painting and sculpture
    with my counselors, Phoebe and Jack. This  was the first time I suspected
    that there were people like me in the world and  felt the possibility of
    friendship. But burdened with self-hatred, I had far to  go before reaching
    out. I escaped to art and hoped that camp, with its emphasis  on being
    natural, would help me find and accept my self.
</p>
<p>
    The head of the camp was Max,  a psychologist from Switzerland. Max would
    tell us stories ‘round the campfire.  I was transfixed and listening for the
    way out of my personal hell. His voice  was pleasant and quiet, not like
    that of my dogmatic and pursuing parents. The  story he told was of a woman
    who thought herself a hopeless loser. Filled with  self-hatred, she hid from
    human contact. I was pierced by this. Wasn’t I hiding  my inadequate self in
    painting and sculpture? Didn’t my counselors know this?  Would Max show me
    how to end my self-dislike? I was scared and hopeful.
</p>
<p>
    The woman went to a  therapist, who tested her. Eventually, there was a
    report. Her therapist told  her that she was inadequate after all. The kids
    all laughed at hearing this but  I was demolished. Another negative nailing.
    My parents were right in  criticizing my every move. The memory of Max’s
    story and my feelings about  being in a hopeless state as supported by his
    story were with me for years.  Max, a person I cared for, was insensitive
    and condemnatory like my  narcissistic father.
</p>
<p>
    His story told me not to  expect improvement. It showed how inconsiderate
    people can be when you need  them to be kind and understanding. Perhaps Max
    was narcissistic and criticized  others to <a name="page150"></a>build
    himself up. Or he was the child of  narcissists who made a joke of the
    torture he had received from his parents.  Either way, the effect of this
    story made my parents’ rating become my fate.
</p>
<p>
    Children of narcissists fear  to know themselves, particularly when what
    they find within is anger. Life with  vituperative parents forces them into
    a compliant posture. When things go wrong  they retreat and do not know that
    much of what they fear from others is a  projection of their inner lives.
    Feelings of their own that are attributed to  others make the world a
    frightening place.
</p>
<p>
    Carol had a narcissistic and  attacking mother and was afraid to know how
    angry this made her since her anger  might show and cause further attack.
    She hated acknowledging anger because this  seemed to make her resemble her
    abhorrent mother. In defense, she had built the  facade of a supersoft
    voice, saccharine smile, and anxious eyes. She found  anger in “powerful”
    people, whom she thought were attacking her. She responded  as if they were
    her narcissistic mother and she their helpless child.
</p>
<p>
    In therapy she walked on  eggs, very fearful and too nice. She avoided
    having a regular session, saying  that her schedule was too tight, but
    always found time to drink in the evening.  She cancelled sessions and said
    she wanted to quit therapy because she thought  I was “unfriendly.” I
    discussed her avoiding sessions to conceal her feelings.  Instead of looking
    at her temper she said I was attacking her. She argued  against it but then
    entered a shaky phase of treatment in which she will come  to her sessions
    even if she feels attacked. Anger is omnipresent in her life, a  part of
    herself she has long avoided. Her husband is equally avoidant. He  thinks
    their marriage successful because they don’t communicate. Learning how
    anger rules her thinking lies ahead. Both he and she will have to face their
    fear of it.
</p>
<p>
    Many children of narcissists  are oversensitive, which means that we
    overreact to what other people say and  do, are hurt and confused by the
    belief that someone intends the worst. We  perceive neutral behavior in a
    negative light. Being hypersensitive is like  having skin so badly burned
    you cannot lie beneath a sheet.
</p>
<p>
    I became oversensitive as  continuous criticism rubbed my ego raw. My father
    criticized my smallest move  and I found safety in hiding.
    <a name="page151"></a>Imagine my panic when I had  to learn the slide rule.
    It was impossible to look long and hard enough to get  the proper marks
    lined up. A correct answer was only possible for bright people  and
    therefore not for me. I felt this way when a friend pushed me to use the
    slide rule correctly.
</p>
<p>
    He encouraged me and forced  me to focus. I said I wasn’t sure that I could
    learn the slide rule, to which  he said, “So what!” That he did not think
    life depended on being free of error  was an inebriating thought. Learning
    for the pleasure of it? Usually I ran from  testing myself, called myself
    inadequate, and avoided finding further evidence  of unworthiness. With
    worry over success and failure stowed, I learned to use  the slide rule. I
    saw from this experience that I exaggerate my flaws. I then  resolved to
    waste less time on worry and more on practicing what I care to do  and know.
</p>
<p>
    A common problem for children  of narcissists is that we do not know when to
    stop being mistreated. We do not  even know when we are actually being
    mistreated since we accept suffering as a  means to winning favor. The
    possibility of favor gives pain a pleasurable  coloring. I visited my
    father’s narcissistic sister. She had a grand dame aura  as if the world
    revolved around her. She kissed my left cheek after not seeing  me for so
    long, then slapped my right cheek for not having been in touch with  her. I
    entered a stunned fog as she laughed at the vanity of her move. She  wasn’t
    bothered in the least by it but I felt embarrassed, angry, and ashamed.  She
    had hit me for not calling her. She was wrong and she was right. Which was
    it? I always felt punishment an appropriate treatment for me and I shuddered
    into withdrawal.
</p>
<p>
    I told my therapist about  this event. He responded that the next time she
    slapped me, I was to get her  arm in a hammerlock and demand that she
    explain why she had hit me instead of  speaking her displeasure. It was
    strange to hear him say that I am not to be  abused. He has said it over and
    over since I am psychologically hard of  hearing. He was not advising
    diplomatic retreat but rather that I wean myself  of the role of being a
    punching bag.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes we feel wounded and  do not notice the wound as we are pulled into
    the need system of the person  harming us. For example, at my graduation
    from college, the narcissistic aunt  who had hit me robbed me of my pleasure
    in this experience. I felt that I was  being hurt <a name="page152"></a>but
    could not see the situation handled any  other way. In the melee I did not
    protest against what was being done. I  thought it would be selfish to do so
    since her needs were more important than  mine. It was my lot in life to be
    mistreated and to ignore it.
</p>
<p>
    My aunt had been deprived of  adequate schooling in Europe and probably was
    jealous of my graduation. Her  grandiose pride would not permit her to admit
    such feelings. She arrived at my  dorm with other relatives. After visiting
    a while, she discovered the loss of a  necklace of great sentimental value.
    It had been a gift from someone famous and  we devoted ourselves to its
    recovery. We opened drawers, looked under things,  and grilled poor Reenie,
    the honest and sensitive-to-tears cleaning lady.  Reenie’s voice quavered as
    she pleaded that she hadn’t robbed my aunt. Of  course she hadn’t. So
    terrible for her after years of service and terrible for  me to be part of
    it. I became depressed.
</p>
<p>
    Did I graduate? I remember  walking along a path to music, wearing a black
    robe and hearing my aunt crying  for her necklace. When she went home, it
    was found lying as she had left it on  her dresser. Her resentful mourning
    for its loss had colored everything. No  apology to me was forthcoming. No
    one recognized any damage. Not even I. I was  not someone of worth. My
    graduation wasn’t worth much.
</p>
<p>
    In an opposite direction,  after being so long mistreated, we can find
    mistreatment when none is there  (although sensitivity may be lacking). Like
    the day in my childhood my  narcissistic father’s relatives were visiting.
    All day, those friendly people  whispered and looked at me out of the
    corners of their eyes. They kept me out  of hearing. It was not like them to
    cut me out so much. I thought they must be  saying horrible things about me
    as my father always did. They had learned the  truth after years of
    erroneous love, which is why no one now included me. No  one seemed to care
    or know how I felt.
</p>
<p>
    This is a narcissistic tribe.  Perhaps they didn’t notice my depression.
    Narcissists are involved with  themselves. Perhaps they thought that my
    exclusion filled me with excitement  and wonder. Narcissistic people will
    project onto others the feelings that they  want to see created. For a child
    of a narcissist, the unknown is fraught with  danger. I did not feel wanted.
    What command, criticism, or punishment awaited  me? Or perhaps, as children
    of narcissists, they did know how I felt and were  enjoying the power of
    passing punishment on to one they “loved.”
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page153"></a>I passed  a miserable day that strengthened my belief
    in my worthlessness. After dinner,  there was a stir in the kitchen and a
    birthday cake appeared, alight with  candles … for me. Eight of them. I
    started to cry with relief. They had been  setting up a surprise party and
    all I had known was rejection. The intended  positive had been seen through
    negative light.
</p>
<p>
    This is an example of looking  into corners and seeing only darkness.
    Children of narcissists do not expect  the best. We are on familiar ground
    when all turns out badly. We are flustered,  frightened, and sometimes
    pleased when it goes the other way, if we can see it.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand,  hypersensitivity to how one is treated or to what one
    fears can have the  paradoxical outcome of making us under-sensitive toward
    others. To safeguard  our skin we ferret out and overreact to anticipated
    mistreatment. We run from  it and accuse the person of intending to mistreat
    us. Our charges are hostile  but we call the other person aggressive and
    charge him or her with having  sinister motivation. Our tone is one of trial
    and punishment. We retaliate in  the present for wrongs we have suffered in
    the past, the sufferings of our  narcissistic home.
</p>
<p>
    For example, a woman in my  psychotherapy group had always been attacked by
    narcissistic parents. She  showed uncanny accuracy at finding people’s weak
    points. She acted as if they  were out to get her, to which her attacking
    them was an appropriate defense.  Nothing could stop her. She hoped that she
    would one day be close to people but  when the group began to point out that
    she pushed them away, she quit group,  saying that no one there could help
    her. She needed the safety of being shut  off. In her self-centered
    rejection of others, she is close to narcissism.
</p>
<p>
    We have to learn if our  reaction to people’s errors and shortcomings is
    magnified by the injuries we  suffered as a child. Children of narcissists
    can have bitter views.  Hypersensitivity swamps the picture and unless we
    lower our standards and  accept imperfections we will have no close friends.
    We need to turn our  hypersensitivity into sensitivity to others’ feelings.
</p>
<p>
    Along with hypersensitivity  is the fear of harm. Years of invasive
    mistreatment, of being corrected and  ignored by narcissistic parents, make
    us think that others will be the same.  That is what we hear when
    <a name="page154"></a>people speak and act. Our waking  world is dark and
    covered by a blackened sky. Unworthy us and punitive them.  Pain is always
    forthcoming. Our sleep is filled with dreams of punishment. This
    expectation rules our daily lives, in which we find intended harm. We are
    hurt  no matter what people do. Imagining such intentions is enough to make
    us feel  wounded. If we choose to be with narcissists, they will actively
    wound us as  well. But we can be hurt by anyone. Socializing is our agony.
</p>
<p>
    Addiction is another common  response to being the child of a narcissist. We
    see it in Nick and Victoria in  this book. Being over- or underweight is
    common but anything can be used as an  addictive defense. It is easy to fall
    into a self-destructive lifestyle after  being treated as expendable and
    worthless. Destroyed by our parents’  narcissistic blindness and without
    someone to observe and comfort us, we now  destroy ourselves.
</p>
<p>
    Why don’t addicts stop? The  problem is partly chemical. But more than this,
    if we ask, am I worth it, the  answer from our internalized parent says,
    “No, you’re not.” Feeling unworthy,  we lack motivation to change our habits
    and improve our lives. We might as well  die by our own drugged hand and
    have a little pleasure on the way down. We do  not know how blind we are to
    what is going on as drugs cover our hostility and  despair. We can be
    friendly on the surface and secretly bitter.
</p>
<p>
    Pills, booze, sex, chasing  after financial success, lovers, you name it.
    Anything can be used as an  addictive distraction that takes us away from
    what we feel. Because addiction  keeps us from dealing with our problems
    (while creating others), we need  progressively more of the drug as
    unattended problems increase and pull us  down. Rather than suffer, we
    increasingly turn to what makes us feel good and  forget. We get further
    away from the knowledge of self that would set us free.
</p>
<p>
    Often our narcissistic  parents were addicts of some kind. They took various
    kinds of drugs, literal  and metaphoric, to shut out the world and we follow
    them on the same or  different substances. Like them, we believe life to be
    hopeless and take their  approach of being out of contact. To become
    unaddicted and function well, we  should know that feeling our pain and
    seeing reality serves a purpose. The pain <a name="page155"></a>only lasts a
    while and seeing what causes our problems  helps us to change in order to
    appreciate ourselves and our lives.
</p>
<p>
    Procrastination is a common  shortcoming of one whose performance has been
    attacked. Low in self-esteem,  many of us think we should put off action
    until we feel sufficiently confident.  It is an error to believe that we
    must love ourselves before undertaking a  difficult project or relationship.
    We postpone what we think is beyond our  grasp, giving ourselves no
    opportunity to learn from error. Raised to magnify  our limitations,
    inferiority feelings keep us from the world. We fail at  school, job,
    marriage, work, child rearing, and so on. We fulfill our predicted  destiny.
</p>
<p>
    We want to strengthen our  skills infinitely before going out; we never feel
    strong enough. One man was  afraid of eating most foods and was always
    readying himself for more extensive  eating. He never ate anything but lima
    beans and “flanken” beef, a Jewish form  of cooking in which meat is served
    boiled or potted. He lived to a ripe old age  but always with that sense of
    putting off the adventure of eating. He hugged a  familiar way which he
    regarded as the safer path.
</p>
<p>
    Our view of self is colored  by our narcissistic parents’ opinions. If they
    manipulate us to fit into their  schema, which gives them satisfaction, we
    feel ourselves to be failures. Even  if we pass high, we think it failure. I
    have progressively hoisted myself out  of the pit of condemnation and do not
    know if I am the idiot my narcissistic  parent labeled me or reasonably
    bright. I have gotten all kinds of labels. My  concern with this value
    system shows I am still vulnerable to it to some  degree. It is hard to get
    free of ingrained negative opinion and to use one’s  abilities fully.
</p>
<p>
    Children of narcissists  usually do not know their abilities because the
    parents’ responses interfered  with their unfolding. Often the child does
    not get into something of personal  interest. An overachiever may do things
    important to her parent but not to  herself. Many so-called “successful”
    children of narcissists have weak egos and  do little outside of given
    margins because success is too important to venture  into the unknown. If
    narcissistic pressure forces a child to achieve, her ego  may not develop
    since she gives credit to her parents. To support her parents’  vanity she
    gives away all credit for what she has done. We <a name="page156"></a>need
    to strive for what we truly desire and if we fail to reach our goal, feel
    stronger for the trying. Self-worth does not depend on the results.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to being hurt we  have learned many of our parents’ narcissistic
    habits since they taught us that  narcissism is the better way. We do not
    recognize that we have narcissistic  defenses and patterns of perception
    that make us behave insensitively and feel  morally correct. If others
    complain about us, we cannot understand. Our  defenses shield us from their
    questions, their pained and censuring voices.
</p>
<p>
    We need to know our  narcissistic habits, that compote of traits we would be
    better off without. Our  narcissism is like the behavior of prisoners of war
    surrounded by  life-endangering guards. To deny our vulnerability, we
    manifest the stance of  those who threaten us. We acquire the parental
    traits that caused us the most  pain.
</p>
<p>
    Narcissism can be manifested  on the inside or the outside. We can be
    internally narcissistic and externally  sacrificing, as when I think myself
    superior to you for the sacrifices that I  make; externally narcissistic
    when I feel inadequate and act superior to you to  hide my feelings. I hide
    inferior feelings from you and me. Vivian had endless  dreams of rejection.
    No man would want her as his lover, few women would want  her as their
    friend. She avoided rejection by being the first one to reject.
</p>
<p>
    Another common narcissistic  habit is to criticize. The child of a
    narcissist who emulates his parent is  always trying to improve the other
    person. That is what his parents did to him  and to everyone else. As an act
    of identification with his parents, he responds  to people’s errors with the
    kind of rage his parents showered on him. He wants  to accept people as they
    are and has been repeatedly told to do so but feels  inner pressure to
    correct. He thinks, “Doesn’t he/she want to know that he is  doing something
    wrong?” The other’s error causes him pain. Rather than consider  the
    distorting effect of being hypersensitive, he personalizes the other’s
    behavior and takes it as intended to wound. Hurt feelings move him to react
    with a barrage of criticism.
</p>
<p>
    Another example of parental  narcissism appears in the child in a mutated
    form. Andrea had narcissistic  parents who lied to her incessantly. Out of
    reaction, she became a compulsive  truth teller and downright
    <a name="page157"></a>unpleasant. Worshiping the power  of the word,
    Andrea’s aggression went into giving unsolicited advice.
</p>
<p>
    People would start getting  close to her and then want to get away. She was
    pained by their departures but  could not admit that her truth-telling made
    them leave. Even when they  complained about her “advice,” she thought that
    telling them the truth was for  their good. She saw them as afraid of what
    they needed and had no awareness of  her vested interest in a missionary
    role. If she felt guilty about the pain she  caused, she told herself to do
    it “one more time.” Telling the truth did the  damage to them that her
    narcissistic parents did to her by lying. In each  instance, the feelings
    and needs of the other person were not respected. A good  example is the
    time Victoria told me that a man I had known and dated for  several years
    once told her that he wanted to be free of me and asked her for a  date,
    which she refused because he was not up to her level. This is  truth-telling
    with a demeaning and arrogant edge. It is how her narcissistic  mother
    talked to her.
</p>
<p>
    If despite complaints from  others our repetition goes on, it shows that we
    have identified with our  narcissistic parent. If we cannot change behavior
    that we know is causing  trouble, look for the gain it brings. Such gain may
    be subtle and include  playing a supporting role to narcissistic parents by
    resembling them.
</p>
<p>
    Much of the sense of self is  in bodily feeling. Often children of
    narcissists don’t know how to read their  bodies because their parents did
    not give the child’s emotional and bodily  sensations an appropriate label,
    did not call a spade a spade. The parents were  not in tune with the child’s
    emotions and labeled the child’s feelings according  to their own moods and
    needs. If we disagreed with them they said we were in  error and attempted
    to change our minds. If we said we were lonely they tried  to make us think
    that people were unimportant. They made us eat when they  thought that we
    were hungry, feeding us portions that they felt suited our  needs.
</p>
<p>
    Alienated from the inner  self, we do not understand the body’s message.
    Estrangement means that our  bodily sensation lacks decipherable meaning.
    Eastern philosophers say that we  are neither body nor mind but that if we
    had to choose the more essential  carrier, it would be the body. By this
    they mean that we are a vibrating energy  system <a name="page158"></a>not
    different from the world at large. But even in  the Western approach, bodily
    feeling is the direct effect of what we think. If  we are sad or happy, our
    body tells us so. The body gives us vital clues to  what is going on.
    Inability to understand the body’s messages keeps us from  deep
    understanding of self. The body is the agent of emotion. Thoughts set up
    bodily feelings although we do not feel the process. If we can’t understand
    our  bodily sensations, who or what are we? Only thought? What is the result
    of  having undeciphered emotional messages?
</p>
<p>
    A person who is estranged  from the meaning of his feelings is puzzled by an
    ache in the heart,  palpitations in the chest, shortness of breath, a
    churning in the stomach, etc.  He is indifferent to or frightened of them,
    as if his head were under attack by  his body. Mind and body are not one to
    such a person.
</p>
<p>
    If he gives practical thought  to sensation, its meaning may be perceived
    from afar. Perhaps he heard of  similar sensations on TV. Such knowledge is
    vague—a word, an idea—but not a  call to action. Bodily feelings that are
    disturbing or even symptoms of a  serious disorder are dimly perceived. Pain
    in the body means that something is  amiss. Pain is a symptom and sign
    asking for attention. Pain differs according  to the severity and chronicity
    of the disorder it expresses. Emotions also  affect the body. Mind creates a
    stomach ulcer, upsets digestion and breathing.  Often we feel a body ache
    without understanding its meaning.
</p>
<p>
    Take the way an average  person perceives and responds to a headache. A pain
    in the head signifies  something in the body, but what? Most people believe
    that a headache is an  inexplicable occurrence signifying nothing, an
    occasion that will soon be over.  Take an aspirin and forget it. The
    children of narcissists can be even more  extreme in ignoring and dismissing
    their sensations. Many children of  narcissists move in an addictive
    direction. With their drug of choice, they  retreat from body/mind feelings
    to an unfeeling state. Sensation is removed but  its cause remains.
</p>
<p>
    Below is a discussion of some  bodily sensations felt by children of
    narcissists who lacked the ability to  understand the relationship to their
    physical state and what to do about it.  There are infinitely more body/mind
    feelings than these. A person who is  alienated from her feelings can
    misunderstand any sensation of which her body,  mind, and spirit
    <a name="page159"></a>dreams. I use the word “spirit”  metaphorically here
    to signify the inner self calling for attention through  ideas and feelings
    that a person can misunderstand or ignore. With such  estrangement, children
    of narcissists may need outside help to understand.
</p>
<p>
    Eric was raised under an  onslaught of parental narcissism and was unable to
    cope. His parents wanted him  to be an outstanding scholar, an A-1 achiever
    compared to everyone else. He was  upset by their pressure to succeed and by
    the stress of competition. Many  narcissistic families make their children
    compete by declaring one the winner  and the others the losers. Their
    children function in response to the parents’  need by feeling competitive
    and imposed upon from without.
</p>
<p>
    Eric was less gifted than his  brother, less able to function under stress.
    He tried but he could not set the  record of unalloyed academic brilliance
    that his parents required. He varied  his goals and defensively did not
    choose a career. In his early twenties, he  suffered a kind of nervous
    breakdown when his kid brother began to show  intellectual gifts. When he
    was unable to ignore his narcissistic parents’  comparing him with their
    other children, his life was undermined by this  intrusive system of
    valuing. He competed for value and felt like a failure.
</p>
<p>
    His parents’ wish that he  excel and his feeling of inadequacy led to
    self-destructive eating. He called  himself a “genius manqué,” a man of
    undiscovered brilliance who buried himself  in food. The child part of him
    was gratified by such behavioral regression. A  focus on eating reinstates a
    period of life when oral ingestion was central.  For the moment, parental
    requirements are pushed aside. Overeating feels good  in the mouth but
    painful to the body. Accepting such pain supports his parents’  view of him
    as unworthy. He is estranged from his body and does not consider  its
    feelings. There is no self-love if you treat your body with disrespect.
    Mistreatment of the self is used to quiet the punishing negative introject.
</p>
<p>
    The only thing he paid  attention to was intellectual perambulations. His
    enormous vocabulary did not  dispel the mental doubt that ruled him. His
    posturing and much of what he did  was more image than content. He created
    an impressive image to hide behind, and  was out of touch with a body that
    went downhill. He quoted Shakespeare to hide  his sense of nonidentity.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page160"></a>He would  appraise his body but did not give it
    sustained attention. Finding himself too  fat, he would grow thin, then fat
    again. Upset by his appearance, he put  himself through periods of overhaul.
    Diet was allied with intermittent maniacal  exercise. He went from no
    exercise to a program of strenuous endeavor. Out of  touch with the meaning
    of body sensation, he was insensitive to his physical  limitations. His
    narcissistic parents required that he go beyond his abilities,  and so even
    with his body, he disregarded feeling. Perhaps he liked the sense  of
    overwork. One day, while jogging, he died of a heart attack.
</p>
<p>
    There probably were prior  sensations of heart difficulty—pain and shortness
    of breath, exhaustion. His  parents’ view was directed to outside opinion
    and unconcerned with the body’s  messages. Many children of narcissists are
    so directed. They are unaware of the  meaning of what their bodies tell
    them. They can develop serious and chronic  diseases, or can die.
</p>
<p>
    The body speaks about  emotional states that the mind cannot understand.
    Ellen had a severely  narcissistic father who aimed to dominate her life.
    She also had a symbiotic  mother who tried to control her by filling all of
    Ellen’s needs. Actually the  needs she tried to fill were primarily her own.
    In symbiotic fashion she  thought her own wishes were supposed to be shared
    by her daughter. Both parents  constantly reshaped the child and tried to
    bring her under their aegis. The  child’s sense of self was depleted and
    thin. Her parents dominated her  self-perception as two warring negative
    introjects. These fought in her mind as  they did in life. Each wanted a
    dominant position in her being and further  depleted her feelings of self.
</p>
<p>
    From this war, she had the  most peculiar body sensations. It was as if each
    arm were being pulled in an  opposite direction and by a different amount of
    force. This tugging had nothing  to do with her desire. She desperately
    wanted it to stop and felt that she was  going mad with this inner sensation
    unrelated to her feelings. Who was the  puller and what was the message? She
    felt pulled apart but did not know how to  read it.
</p>
<p>
    In fact, her body expressed  her feelings, which came from the warring
    parents inside her mind. Each one  wanted total control and in trying to
    achieve this was contradicting the other  and crushing her self.
    <a name="page161"></a>She was emotionally at the end of  her tether, even
    ready to die. She couldn’t stand being pushed around from  within and
    entered therapy.
</p>
<p>
    She saw that she was torn by  indecision. Did she own her body and mind? Her
    introject said, “Your parents  know what is best for you.” This scenario
    made her confused and increasingly  out of touch with her self. It was
    easier to forget her disagreement with what  they said to her than to hold
    on to conflict. Often she did not remember her  ideas, a common confusion
    for children of narcissists. She tried to think what  her parents dictated
    and didn’t recognize that they undermined her thoughts and  moved her from
    her own sensation.
</p>
<p>
    After a considerable stretch  of psychotherapy in which she expressed grief
    and growing conflict with her  parents’ opinions, the physical feeling of
    being torn apart disappeared.  Although conflict with her parents remained,
    her self became strong enough to  occupy psychological home base.
</p>
<p>
    Sensations vary with their  emotional causes. Among the negative sensations
    are anxiety, fatigue, allergy,  feelings from poor diet (like energy highs
    and lows from sugar, allergic  dripping nose and foggy mind from milk),
    hypersensitivity, etc. Attention to  our bodily sensations and our
    understanding of them can be contaminated by our  need for parental
    approval. A parent-dominated mind says, “Do it,” no matter  how we feel. It
    is the parent’s ambition that motivates us. Driven to fulfill  our parent’s
    wishes, we think that our physical needs represent disloyalty to  their
    personal ambitions. Personality and self are almost unrelated.  Personality
    wants the fame required by the parent while the self wants to laugh  and
    relax. In becoming true to our self, can we stand by its needs if they are
    not universally popular? Experience of self is the direction we need to
    take.
</p>
<p>
    Can we develop special  strengths from being raised in a narcissistic home
    and can such strength then lead  to weakness?
</p>
<p>
    John in Chapter 5 was  demeaned by his father into feeling worthless.
    Self-hatred and anger caused him  to fail at school. Failing was his
    subconscious way of attacking his father by  not supporting the parent’s
    grandiose image. That same failure pleased his  father by reifying John’s
    condemned position. After hitting bottom, John fought  to recover and
    <a name="page162"></a>tried many solutions. He developed strength  from this
    fight, especially from seeking a view of life that meditation brings.
</p>
<p>
    John lives under stringent  financial conditions. Using meditation to
    observe himself and his life, he is  able to accept suffering to the point
    of mastery. Mastery entails looking at  pain without a struggle. With
    acceptance, pain withdraws to the outer reaches  of the mind. Buddhism finds
    life filled with dukkha,  a Pali word that means suffering caused by
    clinging to what feels good and  pushing away what feels bad. Dukkha causes
    people to struggle against what is.  Narcissists are especially trapped in a
    push-pull struggle because they cannot  stand their imperfections.
    Meditation keeps you looking at the contents of your  mind until you see
    that all things change. Then the tendency to cling and  resist is lessened.
</p>
<p>
    Meditation is not a good way  to solve neurotic problems. It weakens John in
    his search for his self, since  it is an indirect approach to what must
    change. Many a meditation teacher has  told his troubled students to get
    psychotherapy. This will help them to  meditate without distraction.
    Meditation takes a perpendicular look at what  passes by. The mind’s eye
    keeps the fixed position of an observer. Thoughts  just drop away. Therapy
    follows problems horizontally, staying with thoughts to  their source. Then
    you can pull out the problem with its roots. From this you  discover the
    roots of your problems but the observing position is lost.
</p>
<p>
    Because of the weakness of a  meditative approach to problems, John has not
    analyzed what bothers him. He is  driven by angry rebellion against unfair
    beings whose power he desires. He does  not know that he is impelled by
    anger he could not show his dad. Ventilating  this anger to his
    self-centered boss is not worth the consequences. John does  not know his
    anger’s roots. Holding anger in would allow him to get certified  as a
    meditation teacher. Expressing anger against his teacher turns him into  the
    failure designated by his father. Children of narcissists have indirect
    ways of harming themselves to please their parents. The next step John must
    take is to face the anger he carries from his past.
</p>
<p>
    I asked Delores, John’s  sister, about the strength she derived from being
    raised in a narcissistic  home. Again there is weakness linked to strength.
    Strength comes from  flexibility. A rigid stance creates problems.
    <a name="page163"></a>Delores spoke  of coping with a selfish, violent, and
    narcissistic dad by a force of  concentration that could take her mind away.
    She could do remarkable things in  distracting settings. The miserable
    atmosphere of her home was obscured for her  by her interest in painting and
    dancing. She created an internal scene that  fascinated her regardless of
    what was going on. Shutting out objectionable  events was her strength. As
    an adult such an ability helped her create a  fantasy world in a shop that
    customers could enter.
</p>
<p>
    Weakness also came from this  strength. Used to shutting things out, she
    automatically focused tightly on  what interested her and missed the larger
    picture. People took advantage of  her. Forgetful behavior taught everyone
    including her daughter not to obey or  even remember her requests. She bred
    personal confusion when she forgot where  she wildly tossed her keys and
    spend vast amounts of time recovering them.  There is strength in her
    concentration, weakness in a lack of control as to  where and when she
    focuses. Being vague may express her need for a parent to  take care of her.
    When Delores met her brother’s Zen teacher, he offered her  cookies of
    varied shapes from a tray, and of the one she took he said, “That  signifies
    confusion.”
</p>
<p>
    For Delores to grow strong  again, she would have to gain control over when
    she shuts things out through  concentration. She needs to feel responsible
    for the results of her actions and  not to accept and act out the poor
    self-image her father gave her. She must  also learn not to inconvenience
    others with her careless deeds, as her  narcissistic father did to her and
    the rest of the family.
</p>
<p>
    Often, an initial move for  independence involves joining a group.
    Membership in a group represents  opposition to the parent. A narcissistic
    parent wants to determine her child’s  style and life objectives. Her child
    wants separation but, fearing to stand  alone, joins an all-encompassing
    group as a halfway move to freedom. He thinks  that membership expresses his
    individuality and cites group laws as buttressing  independence from the
    parent. But such membership often limits his search for a  self that needs
    separation to exist. In order not to be immersed in his  parent’s
    narcissistic net he buries himself in a group that operates like a
    narcissistic family and requires identity with members’ goals and ethos. It
    is  a style of life that reinforces personal nonbeing.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page164"></a>Herman  joined Jews for Jesus as a young adult to
    oppose and bug his narcissistic  mother, who followed Jewish law. Extremely
    offended by what he had done, she  plagued him with counterarguments and
    joined a group that kidnapped “joiners”  to “straighten them out.” She
    mailed fliers to families that had “lost” their  children to such groups and
    in her unconscious mind every child returned was  her son.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond the pleasure of  upsetting his mother, how helpful was such
    membership? Immersion in Jews for  Jesus was a step toward independence.
    Rebellion can trigger growth, but only if  it is a jumping-off place to
    further development. Herman later needed his child  to act a certain way to
    give the image of power, indicating that he did not go  on to feel
    sufficiently strong and autonomous himself.
</p>
<p>
    Eventually Herman left the  group since he was tired of fighting his mother
    this way. Needing to feel  manly, he felt it wasn’t very masculine to have a
    group lead him by his nose.  To increase strength requires self-knowledge
    that comes from looking at one’s  doubts. Herman later foisted a pseudoimage
    of strength on himself and his  child. If a person treats his child as an
    extension of himself, the child does  not feel like a person and the
    narcissistic problem passes on to the next  generation.
</p>
<p>
    My own experience with a  group came out of an interest in meditation.
    Through what happened, I saw how  children of narcissists are led by the
    parent into black-and-white thinking. I  was with a meditation teacher in
    the United States who helped meditators awaken  kundalini energy. This is a
    feeling of vibration that travels a twin spiral  path up the spine and is
    accompanied by meditative experiences. Did such  feelings come from the
    teacher or from my imagination? The teacher seemed to be  a catalyst for
    what happened in meditation but what about the rest of him?  Discordant
    facts came to my awareness and made me wonder if meditative good can  come
    from a person who is far from perfect. Or can any good come at all? I was
    raised in an “off with his head!” narcissistic environment in which a person
    was either perfectly good or unacceptable.
</p>
<p>
    I never liked his appearance.  Squinting behind dark glasses, he looked like
    a croupier from Monte Carlo. I  didn’t like his followers, people who
    worshiped him and told us to defer. I  didn’t like his rates, great sums for
    room, board, and meditation sessions, far  more proportionally
    <a name="page165"></a>than is charged in India, where the  teaching of
    meditation is not a business. Where did the money go? The hall in  which we
    met was handsome. I didn’t hear much about hospitals or schools being  built
    with our fees.
</p>
<p>
    As a psychologist and the  child of a narcissist, I am slow to surrender to
    the pressure to believe. I  want direct experience of the facts. I saw an
    article in an investigative  magazine written by some of his former staff.
    Not many of the current group  would read it but I did. It said that the
    ashram’s money went into a Swiss bank  account. It described the meditation
    teacher as a chaser of moneyed folk and a  sexual molester of young girls
    who were left in his charge. It said that he  used the radiance of his
    position to seduce the young folk and called him a man  of temper who had
    once speared his dresser with a fork. As they say, power  corrupts.
</p>
<p>
    This article brought my  doubts home. Now I knew why he seemed to have a
    croupier’s face and why I  always felt a contrast between how he looked and
    what he did to help us  meditate. His followers described their teacher’s
    wayward behavior as a test of  our faith, an explanation that was intended
    to put one’s thought to sleep.
</p>
<p>
    I thought I knew some of his  bad side. My sense of what was good about what
    he could do went with it. I was  swamped with negative feelings. How could
    he teach meditation? I asked others  about the facts but could get no
    answer. How could he or anyone be a  combination of bad and good? My
    narcissistic parents found most people bad and  utterly condemned them.
    Learning this from them, I found bad in my teacher and  condemned his good.
    All or nothing erased the complexity of what is.
</p>
<p>
    It is hard to stop thinking  in dichotomies. His followers said he was
    perfect and the article a lie. They  said he did them so much good that they
    didn’t care what was written. Some  joined me and called him totally bad. As
    I matured, I saw that he was a good  teacher of a form of meditation that
    takes potency from its teacher. I also  believed that he sexually abused his
    young followers, overcharged, and took  funds for personal use. It was
    painful to accept him as a two-sided figure, a  man of high ability with
    significant failings, on the basis of which I did not  want him as my
    teacher. Character is more important to me than skill. The  knowledge that I
    developed from this group experience was <a name="page166"></a>first,  not
    to believe what others tell me and second, that human good is mixed with
    bad.
</p>

    A meditation teacher is like  a therapist. The best therapist is one with
    good character. With such a person  we can be ourselves and trust in his or
    her response. For the child of a  narcissist, it is important not to create
    a false image of self and others in  order to please new people. Part of my
    doubt in this teacher came from a Zen  description in which Buddha is quoted
    as saying, “Slay me if you meet me on the  road,” which means not to believe
    in the image of the man but to reach an  understanding of the essence of
    life through self-exploration.
</p>
<p>
    My meditation teacher told  his pupils that “leaders come from followers.”
    Too long beneath the  narcissistic thumb, I want to test all teachings and
    not to defer to a demand  that I submit. Children of narcissists are raised
    to be believers. Fighting  free of the narcissistic influence, they become
    overly suspicious. The next  step is to develop our own judgment and to
    change what in our understanding is  proved false.
</p>
<p>
    The people in this group had  a brainwashed quality. Hypnotized people are
    happy but not with the happiness  of freedom. When I told people at the
    ashram that I was leaving, his followers  said that I would go to hell,
    which engendered in me a wave of fear. That I  could still feel frightened
    by such threats shows that the child of harsh  parents continues to live
    inside me. The child lives on within the adult but  through analysis his
    power to control gets smaller. The needs of the child are  still felt but
    the adult part of the personality knows that the narcissistic  parent cannot
    meet such needs and directs the self to seek sources of  gratification that
    are more available.
</p>
<p>
    Narcissistic parents used to  frighten me by a withdrawal of their love.
    Despite such pressures I now choose  my own path, which is a struggle and a
    thrill.

<p>
    We need to counter false images that we have accepted, to break the mold  of
    habits that tie us. From childhood on I thought a sauna utterly
    embarrassing. My narcissistic father had despised my body as flat-chested
    and  too large in the buttocks. I wouldn’t dream of removing my clothes in
    public.  One New Year’s week, I visited Vermont with a lover whose friends
    hauled us  into their sauna. I was in a state of dread but there was no way
    to decline  gracefully. I felt so frightened of nudity that I had taken to
    bed and had to  be dragged out to participate. I didn’t want to admit my
    self-dislike to them.  I had intense fear of their agreeing with my physical
    self-rejection.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page169"></a>I won’t  go into the horrors of undressing. Let it be
    known that I found a solitary and  hopefully somewhat hidden position on the
    shelf of a former chicken coop turned  sauna. It was New Year’s Eve and the
    entire crew, including the children, drank  champagne and reclined together.
    We listened to Caruso on a wind-up record  player, laughed, and told
    stories. Mom was unabashed despite an appendectomy  scar. We got so hot that
    we dashed out into the snow on an incredibly cold  night and had a snowball
    fight. The feel of a snowball on heated skin is like a  cool caress. Naked
    and rolling in the snow, chasing one another with snowballs.  What of my
    nudity? It was the snow that counted. Giving and not getting snow on  skin.
    It was terrific. After this, I stopped caring about being seen naked.  Years
    of subsequent experience made it easy. The sauna was great but I like  steam
    baths better. Nudity, big deal! My body too horrible? Who says? Only one
    person, my narcissistic father, whose negative opinion hit home.
</p>
<p>
    Look, taste, touch, smell,  feel, imagine, try what interests you.
    Experience confronts what we are taught  to believe and what was drilled
    into our brains. We cling to our notions but,  short of insanity, cannot
    totally disregard the facts.
</p>
<p>
    We can use techniques to  become our selves and to develop the self.
    Techniques are different from the  roles our narcissistic parents assume to
    cover their footprints so that no one  can follow and evaluate them. If
    recognized as they really are, they expect  further damage to their egos.
    Only a perfect image is safe. Roles help them  avoid detection but a role
    will not help the self to grow. Their roles depict greatness  but
    hypersensitivity to the smallest sign of nonappreciation reveals profound
    and unadmitted doubts.
</p>
<p>
    It is good to experience our  selves with a method by which we are
    transformed but not hidden. A method is  different from a role. The self can
    be itself and use a method to develop.  There are many methods. The one you
    choose should challenge and interest you.  Once, I was looking for space to
    rent from a woman who told me to come to her  party that evening and chat. I
    did not know that it was a casting party. She  needed actors and invited me
    to join the production. After years of therapy, I  could not let myself walk
    away just because I was filled with fear. I told my  quaking self, “These
    are only feelings,” and knew better <a name="page170"></a>than  to succumb
    to terror. Acting had been one of my greatest fears. I felt that I  would
    die on stage. I had already suffered severe embarrassment in the limited
    arena of my narcissistic father’s critical eyes. Surely I would forget my
    lines. My maturing self cornered me into saying, “Now is the time to test
    your  fears, to see if you are as inadequate as you believe.”
</p>
<p>
    We were into rehearsal when  my father visited me and listened with a sharp
    and critical ear as I spoke  lines in the privacy of my room. Although I
    spoke in modulated tones, his  hearing is excellent. Afterward, he mocked
    me, made fun of my voice and of the  necessity of practice. “Is it really so
    important?” He thought my needing so  much practice showed inadequacy. I
    shrank from his words and felt I should not  be acting. For children of
    narcissists, it is hard to take on any project  without parental invasion.
    The parent cannot allow his child to be an  independent being. What if you
    are doing something of which he disapproves?  What if it is something that
    he cannot do himself? I saw in my parent’s  treatment the origin of my
    hypersensitivity and went on rehearsing.
</p>
<p>
    It was a morality play about  a man who realizes that living for money and
    power is useless. At his death he  triumphs because he feels his connection
    with life. The theme touched me  deeply, having been so long abrogated by my
    parent’s tongue. I was happy in my  role even though I played a hostile and
    greedy figure. We have all such roles  within us.
</p>
<p>
    Rehearsals were a torture  because I put the audience above me and was
    afraid of them. Fear of performing  came from seeing them as critical
    parents. My parents told me to be perfect.  Expecting perfection makes your
    errors wound you. Therapy showed a different  way, to see the audience as my
    friends, to do my best and live with it. It was  I who made the audience
    hard to reach.
</p>
<p>
    The play went on and after  initial nervousness I loved the plot’s every
    moment. When the meditative walk  offstage to no applause was completed, the
    audience left contemplating and the  play was over. I went out to find my
    mother hanging on to the stone railing of  the bridge that covered the
    theater’s brook. I expected to hear how bad I had  been when I asked,
    “Mother, how was it?” She looked up, eyes filled with tears  and a catch in
    her voice, saying, “It was wonderful.” We <a name="page171"></a>shared  the
    joy of my courageous impulse. Hypersensitivity grew smaller with each
    playing. We performed and the audience responded. Initially scared, I grew
    to  enjoy the performance. My exhibitionistic part, suppressed in childhood,
    came  out.
</p>
<p>
    How do we find out what is  important for us? It is not enough for children
    of narcissists to follow the  marked trail that others lay before them.
    Strength develops out of fighting  with our handicaps. We evolve from
    struggling to cope with our difficulties.
</p>
<p>
    My parents made me feel  unlovable. My father said that my need for friends
    was excessive and made me  unhappy, that I didn’t fit in, lacked what was
    wanted, so why bother? Thinking  this way was a conveyor belt to loneliness.
    What if my single friend turned against  me, was sick, or moved away? Why
    try to make new friends if the outcome is  predetermined? I found relief
    from such failure in nature. To begin with, my  child’s mind made me part of
    a family of pigeons that nested behind the ceramic  cornucopia outside my
    room. Pigeon humming soothed me, that and the love with  which the mother
    pigeon fed her babies. I considered them as backup parents and  coaxed them
    onto my window ledge for crumbs of bread. It was terrible when my
    grandmother dislodged their “filthy” nest with her broom. I cried out, “What
    of  the babies?” As always, no one listened. Thankfully, the pigeons came
    back.
</p>
<p>
    Loving pigeons and other  animals was the way I bound myself to life. It
    moved me toward ecology. Each of  us must find the thing that talks to our
    heart. As a child, living part-time in  the country, I was very concerned
    with animals. I was a pantheist then and  probably still am, feeling the
    spirit of living things. One time, my father was  driving the final few
    yards before our bridge when a bird, followed by its  mate, flitted in front
    of the car and was hit. He stopped driving to watch it  fall to the ground,
    with its mate flying over, swooping and circling the body.  It was sad, the
    bird wanting to be rejoined with its partner, who lay quivering  on the
    grass. My father did not know how to help as words and paragraphs  tumbled
    from his mouth. Hard for me to concentrate on his words. Perhaps it was
    something about the inevitability of death. He did not offer to go for help,
    to  do anything. I was too numb to speak as he talked me back into the car.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page172"></a>We  traveled the few hundred light years of yards to
    our house to find an ongoing  cocktail party conducted by his girlfriend.
    Guests came over as some tears  began to flow. Away from my disapproving
    parent, I could cry. But the tragedy  remained and no one did anything about
    the bird. I felt abandoned along with  it.
</p>
<p>
    Years later, I joined an  environmental group to keep away a radium dump.
    Then I helped stave off  development of a car wash that would spoil our
    local well water. I worked with  people trying to preserve the local
    environment from total “development.” As I  write, I look at my bird feeder
    and the tiny beasts hanging about. This scene  speaks to and from my self.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes experience is  needed to show us what we lack. We feel discomfort
    and intellectual  understanding but do not really know what was wrong in our
    upbringing until we  see that life is led a different way. Experience drives
    home its point. Travel  can do this for us, which is why I am drawn to
    places far away, even primitive  to some. Although initially fearful, I go
    without an accompanying group to feel  myself “there” as much as possible. I
    learn something of the language and make  local friends.
</p>
<p>
    Travel is outstanding,  because it teaches about how people can live in
    nonnarcissistic ways, although  much of the growth that prepared me for this
    occurred by barely perceptible  degrees, nourished by psychotherapy. What
    drew me to Asia had a lot to do with  being the child of a narcissist. When
    I was very young, feeling repressed and  inadequate, I read a story that
    caught my interest. It was about Tibetan monks  who constructed box kites in
    which they stood erect and flew on air currents  over vast depths of sky. If
    flying made them arrogant they would unknowingly  shift posture and some
    would plummet to their deaths. I do not know if any of  this really occurred
    but I was drawn to a people who wanted not to be  ego-ridden. I had a
    secret, almost magical, wish to go and see them.
</p>
<p>
    Years later, in the midst of  my training in clinical psychology, I also did
    physical yoga and was introduced  to mystical reading. One book, Be Here
    Now, was by  Richard Alpert (Ram Das). Alpert was a former psychology
    professor who went to  India, where he accidentally met and became the
    student of Nimcaroli Baba, a  man with great <a name="page173"></a>mystical
    awareness. Ram Das’s writing  touched me, not only because it was a
    fascinating subject but also because he  spoke the tongues of psychology and
    meditation. He described his teacher as a  man who transcended the greed of
    narcissism. I wondered, could there be such  people?
</p>
<p>
    I read Maya Baba’s God Speaks, in which he described a vision of primal
    intelligence developing upward through all things in order of increasing
    sensitivity until it reaches divine union with itself. This touched my
    feeling  for nature. It said to me that there is more to life than
    ownership. I read  Alexandra David Neel’s writing about walking across Tibet
    accompanied by a  young Tibetan man who was her adopted son and guide. They
    saw wonders of human  ability, like men moving in meditative trances over
    great distances and at  fantastic speeds. They saw men undergoing the
    mind-controlled test, while in  meditative trances, of drying wet sheets
    that were wrapped around their bodies  in the fierce Himalayan cold. It was
    so fantastic to read this that I  experimented with my own mental ability to
    produce heat. I was able to stand in  the cold country air and think myself
    warm, become chilly, and think myself  warm again.
</p>
<p>
    Raised in a narcissistic  family that worshiped excessive ego, I felt there
    was something for me in a  people that eschewed it. Asian mystical
    literature speaks of abandoning the  ego-ridden state. I also loved
    mountains and looked forward to the Himalayas,  days of walking foreign
    paths, hearing nothing but the wind and falling waters.  There was the
    incredible beauty of villages set so high with huge mountains  above and
    below.
</p>
<p>
    And the people! Raised in  isolation, it interested me to be with people who
    regarded friendship as rule  number one. I remember reading Buddha’s
    response to Ananda, his slowest  disciple. Ananda said, “Friendship seems
    very important to me. Is it?” Buddha  answered, “Friendship is the most
    important thing.” What would it be like to go  to a place where at least
    some people were like that? Would I become free of my  fear of rejection?
</p>
<p>
    I was increasingly aware that  we barely use our mental powers. It is common
    to turn off and lead a passive  life. But there are many wonders to know and
    I had too long deferred to  narcissistic control to resubmit to it.
    Darjeeling, in the Indian Himalayas, is  near Tibet. The
    <a name="page174">
    </a>
    expected journey was a gift I’d give myself  when I finished my degree.
</p>
<p>
    When I got my Ph.D. I went to  Asia. I remember my first day in Darjeeling,
    a city of brick and wood whose  curved and winding streets crept up the
    Himalayas. There was a huge round  temple with a friendly eye at its brow
    that regarded all, including monkeys  that scampered in its courtyard. In
    free-standing stalls, there were knitted  sweaters of yak hair, hand-woven
    cotton, Tibetan gems from her inland sea, the  coral and turquoise worn by
    long-haired Tibetan ladies. Appearing from behind  the moving mists was a
    huge and distant mountain, Kanchenjunga, third highest  in the world, on the
    border between Nepal and Sikkim. It was surrounded by so  many peaks up
    there with her.
</p>
<p>
    The people were very calm,  some with painted red dots in the middle of
    their foreheads in celebration of  the religious spirit. I passed a boy in
    his teens who must have had an accident  since he walked the street wearing
    nothing below his shirt. No one fussed or  looked at him in an embarrassing
    way. So much consideration! What kind of city  was this? People did not walk
    about naked. Dress was modest. Clearly his  appearance was due to some kind
    of unavoidable circumstance. There was a fruit  and vegetable market in
    which stood a huge bull, the king of its animals,  sedately munching on
    throwaway rinds and peels. All was alive and strangely  soothing.
</p>
<p>
    In late afternoon, I walked  past a building from which there came a happy
    sound. As I stepped back in the  street to look up to the second floor, I
    was spotted by someone near the  window. Immediately I was invited to a
    beautiful dinner given in celebration of  the birthday of their dead father.
    Dinner was served on a banana leaf. I was  their father’s guest and they
    became my friends. They were beyond narcissism.  In my amazement at what can
    be, I took them as my teachers, so different were  they from the guarded
    suspicion of my home. My heart opened. How can I repay my  friends? With
    love. By telling others about them.
</p>
<p>
    On a hiking permit, I then  went to the mountains with my Sherpa guide,
    Lagkpa. I was welcomed into  villages whose people included me in their
    nightly singing. I walked with them  formally as they pulled me along to
    receive their monk’s gift to us of rice  wrapped in leaves, and other holy
    objects. For each object we made a communal  march to <a name="page175"></a>
    where the monk sat. He gave to us and we gave to  one another. To people
    with colds, I gave my vitamin C, to their kids my  cray-pas chalks and pad
    and watched them draw beautiful pictures until all the  chalks were gone. I
    watched a young boy learn to play my newly acquired bamboo  flute in a
    matter of hours. We all sat on the second-floor balcony of a house  that
    rented the open space to hikers. We laughed ourselves silly watching  people
    creep mincingly across a rope bridge that we had just managed to cross.
    Meanwhile the boy practiced flute nonstop. When he got to quarter notes we
    sang  Hare Krishna to his playing. I had never seen such concentration and
    sharing.  It was impossible to be left out, an overwhelming experience to
    one who had  been raised by distancing narcissistic parents.
</p>
<p>
    Children of narcissists  benefit from stepping into the unknown of any type,
    be it people, reading,  growing things, experimenting, playing instruments.
    It can be a trip to a place  so far from parental judgment that it makes you
    feel beyond your parent’s  reach, so far that you can try out different ways
    of being.
</p>
<p>
    Take sexuality. So much  controlled by our parents’ prohibitive eye,
    children of narcissists often  experience sexual inhibition. In our mind,
    the parent’s eye is on us when we  have sex and can’t let go. Many discover
    their sexual selves when far away from  the external parent, since their own
    desire experienced in the absence of the  actual parent can lessen the
    negating power of the parent within.
</p>
<p>
    I was in Puri, India, with my  Italian friend Giancarlo, a man I had met in
    Calcutta, where we both were so  terrified of the inquisitive glances and
    questions from innumerable people that  we immediately started traveling
    together. We were afraid and resentful of  their intrusiveness, while at the
    same time we were fascinated by them. He had  come to help the refugees of
    Bangladesh who had undergone severe flooding. I  did not fear Giancarlo the
    way I feared my narcissistic father. Giancarlo was  so open and friendly
    that I even looked down on him a bit. Children of  narcissists must learn to
    eradicate such narcissistic evaluation. One night  after eating a large and
    special meal prepared for us by Brahmans, who are  supposed to be especially
    clean, I suffered a terrible case of dysentery during  which Giancarlo held
    me for hours over the latrine, which happily was a hole in  the floor. A
    <a name="page176"></a>floor-level hole let me weakly crouch there  and be
    supported by Giancarlo as I went through the throes of dysentery. After
    that, I had little shame with him.
</p>
<p>
    We were traveling south from  Calcutta, each night neatly tucked in under
    our own separate mosquito nettings.  I paraded around half undressed because
    I never thought of him as a sexual  partner. He was too kind to appeal to me
    that way, not the the child of a  rejecting narcissistic father. It went
    like this until a monsoon cut us off  from the world in our cottage on the
    beach. The utterly black sky brought  incredible winds that banged the
    wooden shutters against the wall. No one was  out in rain that poured down
    in a steady stream, a deluge so strong it could  rip your clothing off. I
    always have been moved by natural things. Perhaps that  is what brought me
    to his bed. That friendly, strong, warm, and generous man  and I were eye to
    eye. Previous experiences of sex had been with narcissistic  lovers who
    closed their eyes and attended to themselves. With Giancarlo,  smiling at me
    open-eyed, I had my first orgasm during intercourse.
</p>
<p>
    I admit that I ran from this  relationship. My defenses were falling and I
    felt that I needed them. I ran  away from a repeat of such pleasure since
    accepting this would mean  surrendering, changing into a person who received
    and trusted. Children of  narcissists are afraid to be undefended. Often it
    takes years of various kinds  of therapy to pry us loose. But I knew a bit
    more about myself and the people I  was choosing. I wanted a man who would
    really make love to me but it took many  more years before I would try it
    again.
</p>
<p>
    For the child of a rejecting  narcissist, the route to affection is not
    direct. The parent sets it up this  way, saying in many ways, first I must
    love you and then the others will. The  child finds himself in an infinity
    of waiting for his parent’s loving  evaluation. Never having earned this
    love, he goes on to seek it from other  narcissists. It is like a fairy tale
    in which you assume a golden horseshoe  lies in the pile of shit. It’s an
    old fairy tale that symbolizes searching for  a valuable item in the most
    difficult and objectionable of settings. You think  the horseshoe is in the
    shit and so you keep on digging. To give up his search  the grown child must
    acknowledge the love that was offered as insufficient due  to his parent’s
    limitations. Knowing this ends the waiting for his parent’s  love.
    <a name="page177"></a>Seeing love fully given by another helps dispel the
    fantasy of his parent’s ability to give.
</p>
<p>
    An experience did this for me  while I was on the Himalayan slopes. If a
    mountain is equivalent to a standing  person, I was at the height of his
    knee when Lagkpa, my Sherpa guide, said, “We  are there.” I was happy to
    have arrived until he pointed upward to the place of  our “thereness,” a
    climb of several thousand feet. A few hours of zigzag  trekking and we
    arrived at a house looking over the world through ancient dark  and
    hand-carved shutters. The house had two stories, with animals on the first.
    I met the house’s lady trailed by a comfortable, naked, and free toddler. I
    saw  him have a bowel movement on the floor which she picked up and washed
    away.  There were no diapers and no fuss.
</p>
<p>
    Later, we all had dinner in  the main room, family and friends, Lagkpa and
    I, our sleeping mats rolled up  and stacked against the wall. We sat in a
    circle near an open-fire clay stove  on which baked an enormous number of
    potatoes. Everyone got a triangular heap  of potatoes, which the Himalayans
    doused with chili and I ate plain. I met the  wife’s mother and their
    friends, who came in through the door without the loud  greeting of the
    West. Everybody seemed to fit in naturally.
</p>
<p>
    The next day, I was sitting  alone looking out a window at the grandmother
    threshing grain on the roof of  the adjacent shed. She was shaking a straw
    sieve while her grandson perched in  a shawl on her back, open-eyed and
    looking about. He must have made a noise  because there he was sucking on
    her breast. She also gave him some food from a  small straw satchel After a
    while he was on her back again. Both of them seemed  content as I plunged
    into a deep depression that lasted days. I did not know  what made me sad.
    Now I know it was seeing a child fully respected and loved. I  had never
    felt that way with my narcissistic parents, who only gave me what  they
    wished.
</p>
<p>
    I was in mourning. Children  of narcissists need to mourn the knowledge that
    such a childhood will never  come to us. I saw how things can be and that my
    narcissistic parents could not  give me this. The same can be said of my
    narcissistic lovers. (This does not  include Giancarlo, my traveling
    companion in the Himalayas, who is not  narcissistic.) With them, it will be
    the same as it has been. My wish and <a name="page178"></a>hope of receiving
    such love from them steals away my energy. I  molder in waiting.
</p>
<p>
    Surrendering one’s  expectation of such a full love from the narcissistic
    parent or a narcissistic  surrogate is childhood’s end. There will be a
    vacuum in response to my need and  not the kind that nature fills. I must
    change the kind of person I choose to  love, which means to change myself. I
    must rethink what I call love. Many  children of narcissists have to
    struggle against what they tend to respond to  and what they will ignore.
    Childhood leaves its scars. Emptiness from the past  pushes us into a
    contemporary arena. I will heal myself by finding love to  share.
</p>
<p>
    Meditation can be of use  since it brings one to original thought. In the
    kind of meditation I studied,  you watch your breath at the nostril until
    your mind stops its wandering and  remains relatively fixed. Then, with
    greater power of focus, you can look into  the energy of your physical self.
</p>
<p>
    The mind uses meditative  watching to empty itself of extraneous contents
    and get down to its essential  substance. It uses our attention to clean
    house. Everything stored comes to  mind, ancient conditioned responses,
    ballads, memories, and fantasies. As the  mental shelves grow empty you see
    aspects of your self long hidden or  discredited.
</p>
<p>
    After hours of looking at  endless memories and conversations, rejections
    and fights, errors committed and  jingles from the radio, I felt that I was
    going mad as my brain poured out  these images like discarded garbage. I
    watched until my thoughts began to quiet  into a mental silence that lasted
    seconds at a time.
</p>
<p>
    In that intermittent silence,  I saw a tiny baby beautiful in its innocence
    and was shocked at what I did not  know. It was myself seen from a new
    perspective. The hatred I had learned had  passed. I saw that perfect child
    was me.
</p>
<p>
    Psychological healing can  come in many ways, including caring human
    interaction, formal psychotherapy,  and the creative use of inner vision. It
    can come from emotional involvement  with the natural world. Healing can be
    an accidental outcome or the result of  deliberate intention.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page179"></a>Here are  stories of help offered to unhappy children
    of narcissists. Some felt helped  and others went away as miserable as ever.
    The consequences of their experience  were not immediate and clear. A person
    can be nourished unknowingly. But the  child of a narcissist is usually not
    helped if what is offered is motivated by  the other’s need to express his
    grandiosity by giving. Responding favorably to  please the giver is
    deferential behavior that further turns the child into a  cipher. Under
    narcissistic pressure, the flowering of self is slow to appear.
    Narcissistic parents think that erring is horrible. Their kids must avoid
    error  even at a brand new or difficult activity. The child fears parental
    judgment  and, to avoid failure, is stranded in the “security” of sameness.
    Errors of  omission are preferred.
</p>
<p>
    The child of a narcissist who  is fighting for existence will try to resist
    what wants to take him over. He  stays invisible to his parents, whom he
    wants to please without acceding to  their wishes. Children of narcissists
    need to dare to have their own ideas and  goals.
</p>
<p>
    The following story shows how  nature can be turned to for help. Wild things
    can be our healing friends. The  story is my own.
</p>
<p>
    Life Among the Savages
</p>
<p>
    There was a little girl who had a little curl  right in the middle of her
    forehead, and when she was good, she was criticized  anyway. And criticized
    and criticized, reshaped by her father the  schoolteacher, who, even though
    they were on summer vacation, never would lay  down the ruler. He prodded
    and shaped and examined her thinking. “Think like a  man!” he’d exclaim.
    (Thinking like a woman was bad? Being female was bad?) He  examined her
    slothful body—”Too broad in the beam; shoulders too narrow,  boyish.”
</p>
<p>
    Her mother was worse; less  intellectual, more basic. She strode about in
    Dad’s torn undershirt, casting  further shame on the state of being female.
    Here, in the summer cabin, she  canned and cleaned and worked and hauled,
    all the while cursing and screaming  and brooding about her miserable lot;
    maligning Dad, who “scribbled,” by which  she meant that he was attempting
    to be a writer rather than earning a lot of  money by having a second job as
    many did during the war years. He <a name="page180"></a>taught for a living
    and had no second job. She screamed out  her frustration at the little girl,
    never seeming to notice the great sadness  and the endless dribble of tears.
    Perhaps both parents were like sharks, unable  to resist the smell of blood.
</p>
<p>
    The child attempted to help  her mother but the mother refused her while
    cursing the child’s helplessness.  Once the child forcibly washed the dinner
    dishes and the mother rewashed them  right afterward. The child asked for
    her own garden patch but was told she’d  not do it right. Mother imparted no
    womanly skills, no skills at all in  learning to care for herself or to
    survive on her own in the world outside.  There was no touching in this
    family, little holding except for her father’s  formal good-night kiss in
    the middle of her forehead. Loneliness was as natural  as the touch of the
    sun on her bare skin.
</p>
<p>
    Outside the cabin, the sun  shone down and the big stream rushed by close to
    the house. Frogs croaked and  peeped their mating songs and turtles made
    turtle sandwiches, three and four  deep, sunning themselves on the shore.
    Frogs leaped away at the little girl’s  approach. She, the little pariah,
    lived in her senses, hearing, looking,  smelling, playing by herself. She
    felt one with the breezes, the whispering  trees, the iridescent darning
    needle that landed on a twig near the great rock.  There were few children
    to play with and, besides, she was afraid to approach  them.
</p>
<p>
    She sat and dreamed and made  up stories about the world. The wind talked
    and sang to her. The birds whistled  and she almost understood their
    message, for she knew there was one. Birds and  trees and flowers knew her;
    they all felt each other. Especially the huge old rock  in the middle of the
    stream was her friend and watched over her. Sometimes she  felt scared in
    the shadows; darker spirits lived there. She’d scurry past to  the light.
    She felt great love for all that trembled and sighed in the wind;  the high
    grasses, the smell of loam.
</p>
<p>
    But still she was haunted by  her inability to do anything right. One day
    she stopped to play in the gravel  pit. She found many little flat stones
    and began to build, not knowing what  would emerge. An apartment house of
    rocks, low flat rooms, with roofs,  setbacks, and shadows like Hopi pueblos.
    There was no plan. It couldn’t be  judged. It just was. Primitive, crude,
    monolithic. When finished, it had little  terraces, places of sun and shade,
    somehow mysterious and yet incomplete.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page181"></a>She went  to the cabin for lunch. Her mother sullenly
    pushed extra helpings on her plate  which she compliantly ate; her father
    quizzed her disapprovingly about some  scholastic fact. Her mother tugged at
    the wild, unruly hair escaping from her  braids. Each was satisfied at
    fulfilling their parent role in reshaping the  little girl. Then she was
    allowed to escape to her rock building.
</p>
<p>
    And there it still sat, a  little cooler and darker in the late afternoon
    sun. Apart, stately, and  mysterious. Suddenly she heard a little noise. Got
    down on the ground, her ear  to the stones. A shrill, rasping sound, a
    mournful soprano letting out a little  shriek. Then many such sounds, voices
    singing, alone, together, trailing off  and restarting, their own rhythms
    and harmonies, their own language, swelling  and fading—at once a sad and
    joyful chorus to summer and the setting sun. Her  building was inhabited! A
    cricket orchestra had moved in, finding it to their  liking. She was so
    excited. The little rock houses were liked, filled with the  tiny creatures,
    telling her, thanking her, singing their contentment, sharing  her sorrow.
    She had made something good and useful. The spirit of the crickets  sang of
    sadness, of love, of the goodness of singing together. Now she was  separate
    from her parents and part of the world of spirits. She was whole.
</p>
<p>
    Since I was never appreciated  for doing anything right, my ego was corroded
    and demeaned by doubt. I  surrendered to the blackest of moods. At
    psychological bottom there is no  hiding in trivial distractions. Often this
    opens us to visions that can take us  from our agony. The crickets were my
    children and I gave to fill their needs as  my narcissistic parents did not
    give to me.
</p>
<p>
    When a person plays, the flow  of the unconscious is closer to the surface
    of the mind. Healing increases when  unconscious and surface touch in a
    fiery force that liberates our energy. We  need to expose our wounds to the
    sun. For children of narcissists, open play is  difficult since we fear
    exposure to criticism and the enemy is imagined near.  If we are alone, the
    enemy dwells within our minds and sees our wounded  vulnerability. Wounds
    are defensively left to fester in the dark, unhealed  beneath their
    psychological wraps.
</p>
<p>
    If human company is absent or  unacceptable, nature may serve since, with
    few exceptions, it does not beckon  with false love and then
    <a name="page182"></a>attack its lover. Things take  their natural place and
    man can learn to live respectfully with it. The human  child, especially of
    narcissistic parents, in seeing and sharing animal life  learns that there
    is another way.
</p>
<p>
    People always try to heal  their wounds but efforts can be limited by
    self-protective and  counterproductive defensive mechanisms of which they
    are unaware. Most children  of narcissists do not perish outright under the
    onslaught of bad parenting but  are slowed down, bound to sticky defenses
    that limit their ability to change.  No matter how difficult, it is better
    to strive to heal. We may need outside  help to free us of constriction.
    Without help, we often achieve but a small  measure of our potential. We may
    have areas in which we achieve competence  while the rest of us is
    constricted by the lack of confidence our narcissistic  parents showed us
    and we believed was justified.
</p>
<p>
    One terrible defensive  outcome is to settle into an emotionally robotic
    existence in which we feel  neither the pain of childhood nor the
    realization of life’s pleasures.  Feelingless and neutral, we defer to the
    parent’s prohibition of our becoming a  separate person. Neutrality is a
    compromise that falls between being and  nonbeing. Some of us are unable to
    assume a “protective” robotic niche but  cannot walk the narrow path of
    life. We fall further to become insane,  addicted, or suicidal.
</p>
<p>
    Developing a sense of self is  a difficult task and we need assistance. How
    are we to know what we seek if we  do not know what help is? Parental
    narcissism substituted its own needs when  responding to our cry, which made
    our emotional situations worse. Even though  we must seek help we may not
    find it. Then help must find us. Sometimes it  does. We are dependent on the
    generosity of the universe and its chance  numbers. Help can come from
    unexpected sources since a uniform does not a  healer make. By uniform I
    mean a degree that gives a person official status.  Some people have innate
    sensitivity. Many were helped and are inspired to pass  it on.
</p>
<p>
    I was about nine when my  father and I went on a summer vacation to a lodge
    that had anti-Semitic  patrons. That’s what he told me. But why would a
    Jewish man want to go there  with his young child? All of his life he worked
    at erasing cultural traits that  he feared would bring
    <a name="page183">
    </a>
    him rejection. He spoke with the  voice of a radio announcer, hoping to pass
    unobserved by hotel guests. His  child was to be the same, another who would
    “fit in.” He did not consider me as  a separate being with my own needs and
    feelings.
</p>
<p>
    I had known his anti-Semitic  criticism but not the reasons for his
    receptivity to anti-Jewish  characterizations. He made me worry about my
    “Jewishness” and, living with him,  I was constantly scrutinized for such
    traits. He winced any time caricatured  Jewish features were present in
    anyone: singsong accent, avarice,  mother-centeredness. He did not feel bad
    if a Scot was smacked with his group’s  stereotype and in fact he enjoyed
    the person’s embarrassment. He lived in the  world of bias, secretly
    enjoying bias against others and fighting off his own.
</p>
<p>
    If someone asked me my  religion while at the hotel, I was to say I did not
    know. Fearful at living in  subterfuge and imbued with feelings of
    inadequacy from constant criticism, I  resolved to stay away from people. No
    questions and no shame. What my dad did  during the day excluded me. I
    didn’t think of him as I rowed down the river and  saw the beautiful water
    and riverbank.
</p>
<p>
    There was an elderly man standing  near the water’s edge. He tended a mesh
    pen filled with something. I rowed over  to look, got out of the boat, and
    walked over. There they were, rabbits. Big  and little, white with pink
    eyes, babies leaning against their parents. Like  rainbows, beautiful and
    effortless caring. I was drawn to the man with his  pleasant smile and no
    questioning. He was stocky, elderly, and quiet inside.  After we said hello,
    paralyzing embarrassment sent me its message … escape. I  was silent.
    Instead of attempting to make me talk as my father would have done,  he
    followed the direction of my gaze and next thing I knew, my arms were filled
    with a huge friendly rabbit that snuggled into my cuddling. I couldn’t do it
    wrong. No complaints.
</p>
<p>
    Each day I went to him and  his bunnies. He would smile, say hello, and fill
    my arms with rabbits. Moments  of quiet, endless contentment. I was happy
    and didn’t think much. Later, my  father was too self-involved to ask me
    what I had been doing, which was good. I  continued. The old man accepted me
    without the painful medium of words. He  nourished my need for loving
    contact and took me exactly as I was. The rabbit  man. My rabbit man.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page184"></a>We are  raised under our parents’ ignoring and
    scrutinizing gimlet-eyed gaze, hard,  divisive, and isolating. The eye
    ignores what is important to us if that does  not coincide with our parents’
    values. Their eyes are like laser beams, seeking  out points of interest in
    us. They apply concepts of “flaw” and “fame” to what  they evaluate. Growing
    up under such a regime, one feels like a bug beneath a  microscope and at
    the same time a child forgotten in a dusty alley. The glance  that ferrets
    out and focuses on their interest, that applies the label “good”  or “bad,”
    pushes us into an emotionally alienated state.
</p>
<p>
    We internalize the quest for  our flaws and watch ourselves in an evaluative
    and rejecting way. Hateful  scrutiny stops us in our tracks and turns our
    spontaneity to paralysis.  Exploration ceases along with performance of
    things we love to do or only do  for the hell of it. We constrict ourselves
    to get away from parental criticism.  Scrutiny, criticism, and constriction
    give existence a lifeless quality.
</p>
<p>
    All children need the  beneficial glance of what I call the rounded eye, one
    that does not focus on  and evaluate parts of our being. The rounded eye
    looks on all unconditionally.  It gives us acceptance and heals the damage
    of our upbringing. Points of light  are those situations, animals, people
    who respond directly and positively to  the child. The child may not call it
    a healing event but something about it  sticks. It remains in his memory and
    is turned to when he feels abject despair  or in need of hope. From what
    happened, his life became more livable. His  self-worth was seen and
    reinforced.
</p>
<p>
    Irwin was scorned by two  narcissistic parents who treated him with barbaric
    sadism. They would humiliate  him with the chore of going to the bakery to
    buy a single, tiny roll. They  liked to do this and the salesgirl in the
    bakery spoke to him with scorn as  well. He had to stand aside until her
    “good” customers had been served. He told  his parents about this and they
    looked forward to sending him again.
</p>
<p>
    They may have been reversing  their roles as mistreated German refugees. Or
    passing on their experience of  being callously handled by narcissistic
    parents. Irwin’s large father would  slap his son’s backside backhand when
    Irwin walked by and mock him for his  complaining. Complaint was Irwin’s
    only outlet for hostility but was truncated  by his fear of parental
    violence. His father had been raised in Nazi Germany <a
    name="page185"></a>as a victim who identified with the aggressor. He used a
    titrated Nazism on his child, giving him a taste of what he had suffered in
    his  own childhood.
</p>
<p>
    Irwin was self-hating,  embarrassed, and angry. He believed that no one
    could share his pain. There was  cynicism in his complaints and he was
    beyond seeking sympathy. At home, showing  weakness caused his parents to
    mock him, treatment that painted its colors on  his world.
</p>
<p>
    Too small and weak to say no,  Irwin was en route to the bakery for his
    father’s tiny roll. He fell in the  street and lay there sprawling, knees
    rubbing the pavement, ankle turned.  Careless, sloppy, worthy of small
    knocks and embarrassing falls. In physical  discomfort, he was thrashing on
    the ground when a man came over and helped him  up and onto his feet. He
    dusted off Irwin’s hands and patted his shoulders. He  wanted to know how
    Irwin felt and didn’t just up and leave.
</p>
<p>
    Irwin heard, “Are you OK?”  and was overwhelmed with feeling. He didn’t know
    what to say and mumbled,  “Yes.” He felt something stir within and wanted to
    escape before the inevitable  harm befell him. What if he cried? He started
    crying, cried and cried. Crying.  Couldn’t stop and it wasn’t over falling.
    Was it the back rub and the polite  and considerate questions that he
    couldn’t get out of his mind? He had never  been treated like this. The man
    waited for Irwin to feel better, held his  shoulder and said soothing words,
    as if Irwin were a sensitive human being. As  if he counted.
</p>
<p>
    A turning point. Irwin talks  about it still. He cried to learn that there
    could be human kindness for him.
</p>
<p>
    Selfhood is created partly  out of the inchoate experiences of early
    interactions between people and  animals, and self-creative activities. How
    do these activities reinforce our  sense of being? To improve a self mangled
    by rejection and improper use we have  to experiment with being. We need
    situations in which to practice the reality  of a self, places that reflect
    our dreams and fantasies, where we can behave in  a way that shows who we
    really are and what we feel. We need responses that  support the development
    of our being.
</p>
<p>
    We are social animals who  find recognition within a group. Acceptance of
    our selves is needed to correct  distorted, isolated, and unacceptable
    self-images. Acceptance draws us back  from self-destruction
    <a name="page186"></a>or a solitary and unrelated life.  There are various
    roads to self-acceptance. If we cannot get close to people  and are
    creative, a healing response can come from our imagination. Creative  minds
    produce islands of benefit.
</p>
<p>
    Experiences between humans  can be nourishing to the self. A mother’s loving
    attention is usually more  nourishing than that of a “stand-in” like the
    police guard at the school  crossing who is kind and considerate to a timid
    child. To a child with  narcissistic parents, however, the importance of
    “stand-ins” can be crucial.  There are rescuers who give more to the child
    than does his family, who do not  see him as a separate person.
</p>
<p>
    A twelve-year-old  prepubescent girl, raised by an utterly critical father,
    is introduced to her  mother’s boyfriend after her parents have separated.
    She is immature and needs  her sexual self to be noticed by a man that she
    can trust. Since her father has  denied her his approval, she thinks of
    herself as a reject. The appreciative  comments by her mother’s boyfriend
    come as a relief. She is uplifted with glee  when he discovers her knees and
    says, “When you are older, how will we keep the  boys away?” He is telling
    her that she is becoming an attractive woman. Young  girls discover their
    sexual role from the stated reactions of men who care for  them but control
    their sexual impulses.
</p>
<p>
    Another young girl of about  six or seven, utterly rejected by her family,
    is given a spent bullet shell by  Roger, the psychotic boy who lives in the
    building next door. He says that this  bullet once took his father’s life.
    Whether any hint of this is true, she feels  wonderfully admired. There can
    be no doubt that Roger loves her, so there must  be something about her to
    love.
</p>
<p>
    A parent’s responses are  highly valued when given directly but the child
    can still be moved without  immediate contact. It depends on who is doing
    the expressing and why. A child  receives a loving letter from a seaman
    father who is gone for months. The child  is sustained and even happy with
    his memory.
</p>
<p>
    Destructive human  interactions and addiction to technology can alienate us
    from our creative  power. Technology means the hollow throb of television or
    reams of data on a  computer. Technology turns out material that absorbs our
    attention and  distracts us from what we need. Denial of the inner life, its
    feelings,  thoughts, and dreams, separates <a name="page187"></a>our
    awareness from the  inner self. If we do not know our creative forces we can
    become increasingly  dependent on our narcissistic parents to give us what
    needs to come from  within. Narcissists enjoy the power of their position
    although they do not have  what we seek. Our self is denied when the parents
    fail to help us back to it  and ultimately we feel that there is no help
    anywhere.
</p>
<p>
    Self must be found. Although  outside reflection is extremely distorted or
    even missing, there are elements  in it that keep us from the most dire of
    endings. There is the strong  biological urge to thrive that walked peasants
    across continents to gain  steerage to America. There is the creative urge
    to weave the materials of life  into a form with which we can function.
    Creativity takes the destructive  threads of life and puts them together
    with something from within that changes  it all into what can sustain a
    faltering self.
</p>
<p>
    Our creative mind bypasses  hackneyed limited thought and shows us who we
    really are. It uses the raw clay  of experience to create meaningful
    relations that allow us to live within the  bounds of sanity. To one who
    thinks herself worthless, seeing her creativity is  a shock. Where did this
    outpouring come from? Is there a worthwhile self? She  escapes into
    nonentity from this overwhelmingly different image but its spirit  calls her
    back. She realizes that she is a person.

    Love for Self, Lovers, Friends, <br/>
    Employees, and Co-Workers
</p>
<p>
    A huge area of difficulty for children of  narcissists, even those who are
    professionally successful, concerns what we  call love. Love is what we
    search for and give to others. What we call love  affects what we look for
    and what we give.
</p>
<p>
    We left childhood feeling  terrible, with some idea of the how but not the
    why of it. We live in clouds of  doubt and confusion. A big step
    <a name="page189"></a>forward is to not take  total blame for what we feel.
    Events occurred with our parents that hurt us  even though they said what
    they did was for our good. We heard that punishment  was harder for them to
    give than us to receive. From all our painful “lessons”  and experiences, we
    should know that our self-hatred is a learned response.  This will not make
    self-hatred go away but does give motivation to change.
</p>
<p>
    Our parents gave us negative  responses. They greeted us in temper, saying,
    “How awful you are.” They  ignored, threatened, yelled at us, and gave
    insufficient touch. We echoed their  point of view and thought, “I am
    unworthy of love.” We took acceptance of their  view a further step and,
    rather than see them as rejecting, turned their  hurtful behavior into love.
    Scolding, forgetting, demeaning, aggrandizing,  demanding—all their
    destructive ways were labeled love. In an attempt to  understand and accept
    our pain, we think that we have not been good enough to  earn sufficient
    love. We grow up to seek love from similar people.
</p>
<p>
    The adult child of a  narcissist does not know his unconscious love-seeking
    mission as he creates painful  relationships. A healthy personality does not
    seek rejection. The adult wonders  why he ends up with abuse. Many complain
    about the very thing they hold on to  and do not admit to the pleasure that
    it gives them. Delores has a child who  will not do what is asked of her,
    even after she has agreed to do it. That is  how Delores raised her and, in
    spite of grumbling, what she wants.
</p>
<p>
    If a mother wants her child  to change, she will refuse to put up with
    abuse. Delores’s child tried on her  mother’s clothing in rebellion against
    a stated demand that she not do so.  After the trying on, she left the
    clothing lying on the floor. A mother who is  sincere about her wishes would
    throw her daughter out if she did not stop such  misbehavior. If instead,
    mother pleads with daughter to stop and secretly  reinforces the abusive
    treatment, it goes on. Sometimes, awareness of why we  select pain can only
    be learned through therapy. Otherwise our defenses keep us  out of touch and
    churning in the murk.
</p>
<p>
    When do you think that love  was given you and how did you receive it? Do
    people in your adult life treat  you in similar ways? Many children of
    narcissists blindly repeat patterns of  inadequate loving. As adults, our
    childish minds, which wanted love from the  narcissistic
    <a name="page190">
    </a>
    parent, choose narcissistic partners with whom  we continue to struggle for
    love. This childish wish undercuts our power of  decision to move on. It
    keeps us on an unrequited search. Our adult minds  suspect that love won’t
    come but don’t know how to break our patterns of choice.  We are out of
    touch with thoughts and feelings that have their hold on us. We  see our
    habits but not our blind spots. We can be intellectually aware of our
    interest in narcissistic people but emotionally we are unable to change.
</p>
<p>
    Delores exemplifies this. She  does not see how her boyfriend resembles her
    father. She says, “He is unlike my  father except in the shape of his
    shoulders. They both are short and walk  stooped over.” She responds to my
    comment about repetition by asking, “Why  would I want to relive my father’s
    love since he had no love to give?” I ask  why she stays with her current
    man and she says that she only likes his  intelligence. Sex is horrible
    since he will not learn to do what she likes,  including touching her
    breasts. Sex is only for him and infrequent as possible  but she enjoys
    sleeping curled together like two bears.
</p>
<p>
    She doesn’t see the picture  overall, that father and boyfriend were
    critical, argumentative, violent,  withholding, and financially on the take.
    I ask her to look more closely at her  feelings for her boyfriend and she
    explodes with, “I can’t stand him.” This is  said of the man she calls
    darling as she perpetually wards off his verbal  attack. She tells me that
    she does not like any of the men she has loved. I ask  her if she misses
    good sex with the current boyfriend and she says work is the  only thing
    that counts. Unless pushed, she stays away from her feelings by  leading a
    peripatetic existence like the one her mother led with her dad.
</p>
<p>
    Like many children of  narcissists, Delores gets pleasure from misery, a
    process that is  sadomasochistic. With her boyfriend as a stand-in, she
    works for and awaits her  father’s unavailable love. She walks an
    emotionally spiked path out of  childhood. Children of narcissists are
    miserable but hang on by taking pleasure  in such misery to make life
    bearable. The child enjoys her parent’s scolding,  forgetfulness, demands,
    and intrusions. Such pleasure continues to have allure.
</p>
<p>
    Here is another example of  selecting a partner with whom each episode is
    pleasurable torture accepted with  the hope of change. Since his self was
    rejected by narcissistic parents, the  child of a narcissist turns away from
    his self and finds its need for love  unfamiliar. The area
    <a name="page191"></a>of love is taboo and frightening. He  is so hurt that
    he avoids dating until emotional needs mount to the point where  resistance
    is overcome. Then he turns toward a narcissist who cannot give. He  takes
    the pain of deprivation as love or at least the path to love.
</p>
<p>
    A woman had an affair with a  narcissistic man. He was very sexual. He even
    grabbed her breast in a joking  way when the subway car took a darkened
    curve. She found love in the sexual  crumbs of their relationship. After an
    agreeable bout of sex, she was lying  beside him feeling spent and happy
    when the phone rang and he answered. It  turned into a lengthy long-distance
    phone call with a woman she later found out  he thought he still loved. The
    woman had rejected him and the hook of desire  remained. Perhaps it was
    baited with the worm of rejection. A narcissist wants  to be the one who
    deigns to leave.
</p>
<p>
    The child of a narcissist lay  beside him as he talked. She couldn’t believe
    the call and tried to deny it.  The call would soon end. It was impolite
    and…. Time went by and talk went on as  she rose, put on her clothing, and
    departed. He did not notice her leaving as  he talked to his “chosen one.”
    He had enjoyed their sex but now did not have a  flicker of awareness about
    her feelings or whereabouts. His attention was on  the phone call.
</p>
<p>
    She read love in their passion,  clung to him, and hoped for change but he
    did not say a word about permanence.  In his sexual orientation he was like
    her father, who valued female beauty and  wanted it on call. Her father
    handled his Oedipal attraction to her when she  was a child, along with his
    need for superiority, by denying that she was  attractive. He called her
    body unworthy, which kept desire out of his mind. She  believed what he said
    and thought herself ugly, though early photographs show a  pretty, wide-eyed
    girl. He did not easily kiss her but held her head firmly  between two hands
    for a mid-forehead buss. It was like the three-way holding  machine on the
    head of an animal about to undergo surgery. From her parent’s  touch she got
    the notion, who would want to touch me?
</p>
<p>
    She was used to being ignored  and submerged in her dad’s self-centeredness.
    Although she hated being  criticized, she associated it with love. Sometimes
    she felt loved when nothing  was given. Children of narcissists manufacture
    this feeling from whatever comes  their way. <a name="page192"></a>She
    developed distorted notions of loving. It  was a familiar situation if her
    lover was not there when she needed him. As an  adult, she became pregnant
    by her boyfriend and wanted to have their child.  After arguing with her to
    have an abortion, he totally disappeared. Although  she intended to have the
    child, the pregnancy ended in miscarriage.
</p>
<p>
    We find ourselves confused  and hurt by what we call love and think it a
    thing to be avoided. This is often  the result of having at an early age
    loved something that was deliberately  taken from us. It is worth
    remembering experiences in which our love was  nipped, when the thing we
    loved was removed, lost, destroyed, or turned against  us. This memory shows
    us that it is untrue that we have never loved at all.
</p>
<p>
    Regardless of what our  narcissistic parents say, we learn to love by
    loving. Narcissistic parents  often frown on their child’s love for an
    animal. They think he will never will  love a human being, as if the
    capacity for love were limited as a pie. The  narcissistic parent thinks in
    simple equations. If you love this, then you  cannot love that. Rather than
    recognize the limited capacity as his own, the  parent projects it onto his
    child. If his child loves lower down the animal  scale he cannot love higher
    up. Loving a cat means he will only care for cats.  Parental judgment is
    communicated to the child, who responds by limiting the  loving he feels and
    filling his mind with doubt.
</p>
<p>
    I remember at age eight how  my kitten set it off by running up the
    curtains. Also there was Smoky, my fox  terrier-type dog, and Uncle Al, the
    alligator who stretched out on my hand for  a belly rub and scared my
    grandmother with its carpet runs. I was told that all  my adorable pets must
    go. I defended against total loss by holding on to Smoky,  my dog friend
    since I was five. We were barricaded in my room with my dresser  to the door
    and my shoulder to the dresser, pressing against the screaming and  pushing
    from the hall. Smoky barked by my side. It was a desperate situation.
</p>
<p>
    Later I emerged to see no  kitten and no alligator, and no one would discuss
    my loss. It was later said  that Uncle Al was “somewhere in school.” I was
    bereft, but at least I had my  dog. I couldn’t share what I felt. They were
    right. Love is risky. My parents  said that loving animals kept me from
    loving humans. Now I was fearful of  loving <a name="page193"></a>animals
    and humans. They probably saw in my fear the  justification for what they
    had done.
</p>
<p>
    It is painful to lose what  you have loved. The desire to love is flanked by
    the fear of loss. My parents  blamed this feeling on my pets. Would I want
    another pet? The inner parent  criticizes my need. Does loving an animal
    cause lack of love for people? I need  to test the hypothesis that love for
    one stands in the way of love for another.  I think that love breeds love.
    The narcissist’s love pie is limited since he is  preoccupied with
    self-concern. I do not subscribe to the pie theory.
</p>
<p>
    I learned from current  examination of my love for animals that the more
    things I love the more I can  love. I see that my parents constantly
    criticized the things I loved and that  my fearful holding back was learned.
</p>
<p>
    We need to stay open to new  information in the face of learned negative
    judgments against the self. Pauline  was on vacation. She had been persuaded
    to go to a certain hotel that bordered  on a state park and had beautiful
    walks. She dreaded meeting the people with  whom she was to socialize.
    Versed in self-hatred, she entered the hotel lobby  and heard laughter. She
    thought, “They’re laughing at me,” and wanted to leave  right away. She
    thought, I can walk right out this door with my suitcase in my  hand.
</p>
<p>
    Previous therapeutic work on  self-hatred came to her mind. She remembered
    that she tended to personalize  unrelated behaviors and decided to stay a
    bit longer, signed in, dragged  herself to her room, deposited her luggage,
    washed her face, and went  downstairs filled with fear at having to meet the
    laughers, who turned out to  be friendly. She saw her error in thinking that
    people would instinctively  reject her. Her rejectable self-image dissolved
    a bit more. Just a bit. All of  such experiences add together until it is
    impossible to assume the worst.
</p>
<p>
    We need to allow people to  get close regardless of how poorly we regard
    ourselves. We can learn from  social errors. Victoria is sitting on the
    dating fence again and speaking of  how hard it is to change. If she shows
    interest in a man, she thinks she will  be rejected. Her narcissistic mother
    raised her to fear men, to feel  incompetent and ugly, although she is
    beautiful. Victoria says, “You know that  I was toilet-trained far
    <a name="page194"></a>too early and later was a soiler  and wetter. I walked
    around with shitty pants and still feel that way.” I laugh  and respond with
    my own remembered physical failings. “When I was young and  upset or even
    pleasantly excited, I always had a nosebleed. I had nosebleeds  when the
    person I depended on left my side, like the night I discovered that my
    mother had gone away for the weekend. She had left me without explanation in
    the care of a narcissistic aunt who criticized me until I worked myself into
    an  asthmatic fit with tears. Oh yes, I had asthma in those days. No
    breathing when  I was upset. My nose would bleed and pour blood all over
    everyone. Like the  time my girlfriend Barbara was visiting. She shared my
    bed. That morning we  woke up in a pool of my blood. It turned out that I
    had my period and my nose  was also bleeding. I gave Barbara the full
    treatment. Of course, I thought that  every mishap including nosebleeds cast
    me in a miserable light.
</p>
<p>
    “Also, I almost forgot that  when I was younger, I would vomit in the
    automobile. Also on the trolley car.  We would have to get off the trolley
    before our stop. Once, on a car trip, I  complained so much about needing to
    vomit that my friend Alice lost control and  without saying a word vomited
    on me. I didn’t vomit that time.”
</p>
<p>
    Victoria was laughing. My  nosebleeds and vomiting matched her shitty pants
    and even with such an image, I  was dating! Hot on the topic of feeling
    objectionable, I reminded her of how we  children of narcissists are raised
    to think in terms of black or white. My  father was perfect and my mother
    horrible. I was a genius or an inadequate  idiot, good or bad with nothing
    in between. I was perfect or unacceptable. I  accepted these standards in
    order to see myself as a failure and so did she.  Men have to make it to the
    upper rung to count with us. I said, “Those who  don’t meet our values are
    worthless. You with your bed-wetting and me with my  nosebleeds are
    defensive stinkers. Who would want to know us?” Victoria laughed  again as I
    added, “We get rid of them first. If I meet a man I fall upon his
    imperfections.”
</p>
<p>
    From Victoria came, “It is  horrible that we follow such habits. We know
    ourselves and do it anyway. We’re  stuck.” To this remark I counter, “We
    call ourselves stuck to avoid taking  chances. If we’re stuck we’re safe.
    One of the most healing things ever said to  me was, ‘Go out and make a
    mistake.’ You say no men are interested in you but  they are looking for a
    sign of interest. If no one comes over, you are not sending
    <a name="page195"></a>the signal. Was your mother right when she said no man
    could like you?” I challenge Victoria to go out.
</p>
<p>
    Victoria agrees and adds,  “All people are good and bad. Can I accept a
    human being with his errors? Can I  accept myself that way? I see myself as
    an ugly child with shit in my pants.” I  tell her, “Go out as ugly as you
    feel. Me stupid with a bleeding nose, and you  with shit in the pants and
    insecure.” She says, “Yup. At least I no longer have  to cover myself with
    makeup.” Victoria had always worn a ton of makeup. Before  any of the other
    girls, she was made up by her mother, who found that she had  ugly “fish
    eyes.” The idea of ugliness went very deep. Clearly a disguise was  needed.

        EVELOPMENT
    </a>
</h1>
<p>
    We become ourselves by emerging from surrender to our parents’ need for  us
    to be a certain way. We need to develop a point of view independent of the
    one held by the parents whose love we need, even if they take our
    independence  as a personal rejection. In the material that follows, we see
    the development  of inner strength from less to more, the problems,
    shortcomings, and weaknesses  commonly encountered. Also, we see the unusual
    abilities that develop out of  becoming a unique person. Although the best
    judge of what you need is you, if  you cannot hear your inner voice, it
    might be good to seek outside help. In  this light, some kinds of therapy
    are discussed.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page197"></a>The  people next depicted—Mary, Lorrie, Nick, Tillie,
    Alice, Doryan, and I—are  children of narcissists in progressive states of
    breaking loose from the  abdication of our selves. Mary has surrendered so
    much that her life is  directionless and miserable. Lorrie’s surrender is
    less destructive in that it  moves her to develop skills that make her happy
    because they help others. She  enjoys and lives through their pleasure. Nick
    hates containment by his parent’s  need but movement toward independence is
    stuck in a negative and rebellious  stand. Tillie also rebels but in a way
    that is useful to others by being  compulsively “helpful.” Alice gives
    personal effort to vocational goals in  which she retains control, but does
    not get close to people. Doryan has  mastered his craft and gets pleasure
    from a love relationship whose closeness  he limits to a degree that he can
    stand. The acceptable level of closeness for  him is well below average.
    Then there is my story, still growing and unwilling  to accept neurotic
    limitations as permanent.
</p>
<p>
    Mary
</p>
<p>
    Mary is a San Francisco girl whose defensive  nonexistence excludes regular
    work. At twenty-one, her life lacks commitment to  long-range goals. Nothing
    gets the attention that it needs. Even her vow to be  thin is an up-and-down
    affair whose frequent falls are torture. Having chaotic  objectives makes
    her miserable but she also laughs at her constant changing as  if it were a
    joke. She basically remains the same, so there is psychological  gain in
    what she clings to. Otherwise, why would she choose to live on a low
    income, without a career, with no material way to enhance her sense of
    self-worth?
</p>
<p>
    She wanders between  uncompleted objectives, impulsively seizing and
    dropping goals, some of which  her mother likes. Other activities are simply
    done for cash, like waiting on  tables or baby-sitting. Menial jobs have
    replaced spotty attendance in college.  In so many ways, she is paralleling
    her mother’s career. Her mother was an  academic star in high school who
    avoided college and had inadequate income in  her early years.
</p>
<p>
    Mary’s mother had a  narcissistic, critical mother and an extremely
    narcissistic father who demanded  service and obedience. He deplored,
    <a name="page198"></a>hit, and eventually  abandoned his family. Abandonment
    became his daughter’s dread event, which led  her to seek dependent lovers
    and to raise Mary as a clinging child. Mother’s  unstated needs run counter
    to her stated expectation. She is concerned about  her daughter’s future but
    does not require her to have a vocation. (A lack of  maternal financial
    support would force the issue.) Does she want an independent  daughter or a
    child who will never settle down?
</p>
<p>
    Mary’s grandmother’s husbands  were alcoholic and her mother’s were into
    alcohol and pot. Daughter Mary  followed suit with a boyfriend who drank and
    was financially dependent on her,  which made him indirectly dependent on
    her mother. A child ordinarily walks the  parent’s footsteps. If the parent
    has a narcissistic bent the pressure to copy  is strong.
</p>
<p>
    Mary’s mother is angry at her  daughter for not doing what she tells her but
    this is only surface grumbling.  Unconsciously she enjoys her child’s
    dependency and disregard for feelings.  Criticism flows from daughter to
    mother since Mary is angry at her mother for  having problems she must copy
    to please.
</p>
<p>
    Mother was raised to be  beautiful, popular, and a good student, but she was
    also full of resentment at  the pressure of parental demands without the
    reward of adequate love. She never  found out how much attention was enough
    to give or get and now her child  suffers from the same confusion. Mary
    gives too little attention to others and  to herself. She also expects too
    much. Here are three generations of women  raised by narcissistic parents to
    be abused, abusive, and narcissistic.
</p>
<p>
    Mother does not know her  proper rights. She puts up with mistreatment and
    doles it out. Her daughter was  raised to worship Mother’s idealized image
    but one of her mother’s primary  traits is not needing or respecting limits.
    A trait that smacks of power can be  idealized, even or especially one that
    made you suffer. Here is an example of  the truth that you cannot give what
    you have not received or developed.  Daughter respects no one’s needs,
    including her mother’s. Raised in confusion,  she passes it on.
</p>
<p>
    Extremes of caring come up  all the time. Mother’s inattentiveness is
    bracketed by “spoiling.” Mary hates  being ignored and behaves badly to get
    attention, caring little for what others  need and deserve. The main thing
    is to get her needs met.
</p>
<p>
    Mary is endlessly on the  dole, taking advantage of people, misusing
    <a name="page199"></a>her mother’s  charge card, which was only supposed to
    be used in emergency, overwriting  checks, running up bills, acting like a
    spoiled rich girl on a spree who will  always be bailed out. Mother is
    working hard and financially only up and  coming. Her daughter’s spending
    sprees make great holes in her budget and bring  hardship around the bend.
    Mother rationalizes what she does, saying that what  she gives Mary is an
    “investment,” but in what? Daughter says she will repay  her mother but
    gives so little back that it is but a token against the mounting  hoard of
    things received. Mother fills her child’s endless requests, soothing  her as
    she once soothed her narcissistic father by filling his materialistic
    needs. Copying of the self-attentive narcissistic attitude occurs and the
    child  becomes like its parent. Narcissism passes on.
</p>
<p>
    Last night I had a dream  about the two of them. Mother and daughter gave a
    party to which I came. I took  off my shoes, which they took, and soon
    forgot where they left them. Mother  brought out several pair of pumps,
    attractive, purple suede shoes which she  held up for me to see. It was
    unstated if I was to wear them, but I saw that  these would not fit. In
    bringing me such shoes, she may have been showing off  what she possessed
    and offering me what was inappropriate. In the same way,  Mary was trained
    to be endlessly on the take from Mother and not to earn her  way.
</p>
<p>
    I then realized in the dream  that Mary had taken my handbag to a neighbor’s
    house and it was missing. Mary  and her mother searched for my things but
    were not much concerned. There was a  likelihood that I’d have to leave
    without my shoes and possessions. A missing  pocketbook indicates that I was
    financially abused. They acted gracious but did  not seem to care. This
    dream shows the self-centered vanity of narcissism. My  suffering at their
    hands was not understood or appreciated.
</p>
<p>
    As a narcissistic duo, Mary’s  tirades express her mother’s rage. Mary’s
    beauty and charm express her mother’s  desired image for Mary and for
    herself. Mary complains about confusion and  works beneath capacity at what
    she takes as an experimental lark to be dropped  when its novelty wears off.
    She doesn’t recognize that people make commitments  after years of work. She
    hopes that the star of truth will one day fill her sky  and until then, she
    will lead an undirected life that ties her to her mother.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page200"></a>But there  is progress in that Mary has come to know
    that she is miserable and has entered  therapy, where the question of who
    she is and what she wants to be is  constantly asked. To this end, to
    achieve a career she has reentered college.  To change, Mary will need to
    stay in therapy. Her mother has become a little  aware of her ambivalence
    over this but without therapy of her own still needs  her daughter to be a
    dependent child.
</p>
<p>
    Lorrie
</p>
<p>
    In contrast to the unhappy and withholding state  that connects Mary with
    her mother, Lorrie, discussed here, and Tillie, in a  coming description,
    are agreeable people who focus on helping other people.  Lorrie’s childhood
    was shaped by a narcissistic and extremely insecure mother  who demanded
    that Lorrie greet people with eyes opened wide and a generous  smile. She
    was to feel their pain and react with sympathy, to show interest in  their
    problems and, before that, to care about her mother’s self-dislike and
    misery. She was not to consider her mother’s self-centered demandingness
    unfair. As her mother needed her, she was to be a “giver.”
</p>
<p>
    Giving was to rule supreme.  Lorrie thinks of giving as her natural state.
    She takes feelings of inner  emptiness as a sign of personal lack from which
    she is to turn away and give.  The more she gives, the less she knows
    herself. It is satisfying to see  another’s joy but this does not answer the
    question, “Aside from satisfying  them, what do I want?”
</p>
<p>
    She did not have sufficient  access to the force of early childhood, as, for
    example, a two-year-old’s  statement, “I won’t do that!” Identity grows out
    of self-assertive events.  Instead, Lorrie was pushed into saying yes, to
    which she complied with forced  acceptance that sent a self into hiding.
    There is strength in her ability to  understand others but no increase in
    personal power. Children of narcissists  serve their parents and if the
    parents are pleased, find satisfaction in  self-abnegation. They feel
    rewarded by the response to the degree that their  selves do not count.
    Without a sense of personal value, they do not recognize  the misery that
    submissive fealty brings.
</p>
<p>
    Lorrie feels the other’s  plight and negates self-interest. She does
    <a name="page201"></a>not try to know  that self and thinks it not worth the
    trouble. Self is felt to be distant,  vague, and fearfully rumbling. As
    Sam’s wife, she supports his narcissistic needs,  listens to his problems,
    and applauds his feats. She ignores or demeans her  own.
</p>
<p>
    She became very sensitive to  people’s feelings because her mother was so
    easily hurt. Mother always demeaned  herself and needed redeeming praise.
    She saw personal evaluation in all that  her kids said. They had to have the
    “right feeling” toward her and her causes.  Since she required them to tell
    the truth, it was protective for them not to  know what they felt. She would
    beg them for comment, to which they acted  neutral, pleasant, and
    unknowable.
</p>
<p>
    As with her own self-regard,  Mother’s remarks to her kids were full of
    contradiction. She was demanding and  critical, full of adulation and
    disappointment. She swung up and down, from awe  to jealousy and back. Her
    compliments were unreliable as she called her  children good but not good
    enough. She even talked to me that way about myself.  “You are brilliant”
    she said and then asked me about an embarrassing cyst.  “What is that red
    mark beneath your eyebrow?” She called Lorrie beautiful and  then pulled at
    her hair, saying, “Why do you let your bangs hang that way? They  look
    terrible.” I heard that Lorrie’s aunts found her “mature” at an early age.
    She had to be mature since she was her mother’s advisor.
</p>
<p>
    The sense of self for Lorrie  and her brother was demolished by the way
    their mother fed them. She thought  that feeding them made her a good mother
    and tried to make them eat. At the  same time, she revered thinness, so
    their not eating also pleased her. Perhaps  not eating pleased Mother more
    because that is what they did. They resisted and  complied at the same,
    sealing their lips against food and becoming so thin that  in the movies,
    she had to hold down their seats while they were sitting in  them. Luckily,
    she was not so forceful that they were driven to assert  themselves by
    bringing noneating to a suicidal end.
</p>
<p>
    Saying no to controlled  eating could have been a step toward independence,
    of which there were too few.  But it was as much compliance as assertiveness
    that turned Lorrie toward the rejection  of all things nourishing unless it
    gave another person satisfaction. Lorrie  could not overcome the guilt she
    felt for her mother’s reactive pain at <a name="page202"></a>her
    independence. Lorrie’s sacrificial response became a  conditioned habit.
    Like Nick, she said no to self but unlike him, said yes to  others. She
    found acceptance in supporting their plans and pleasures.
</p>
<p>
    Lorrie’s child shows the next  generation reacting to parental narcissism
    and sacrifice. Her young son  remembers what people say, notes their needs,
    and makes sacrifices to help.  Like Mom, he eats little and is thin. Like
    Mom, he asks for little and is  appreciated for that. Remembering unusual
    facts shows his intelligence, a value  that his dad respects. It is the
    brilliance of which his grandmother always  speaks. He draws with crayons,
    which his dad favors. Brilliance wins his  father’s approval. Brilliant is
    what his grandma calls him. When sacrificial  and unbrilliant, he vanishes
    into a supportive haze … like Mom. Overall, he  features intellect, talent,
    few needs, much sacrifice, and a smile.
</p>
<p>
    Lorrie became a  psychotherapist who would not take credit for her work. She
    denies therapeutic  ability, showing modesty that keeps her in line with her
    mother’s feelings of  inadequacy. Mother was too jealous and paralyzed to
    accept a child who  appreciated herself. Lorrie puts herself down and the
    other person up. I asked  Lorrie why she did not continue her schooling.
    Therapists need a lot of it. She  responded, “I am no scholar,” and added,
    “My papers were only ‘copied.’ ”  Weren’t all our papers derived from other
    sources? She does not think of that  and speaks this way to justify ending
    her education.
</p>
<p>
    There is a lack in her work  if she tells a patient to expose himself but
    she cannot take the risk herself.  Lorrie speaks of her failures, which she
    exaggerates. She thinks herself a  beggar who is generous with another’s
    money and does not know the money is her  own. She needs to know who she is
    when not serving another’s need.
</p>
<p>
    She has talent for living in  a submissive position and is used to taking
    second place. She does not like  doing psychotherapy with a prison
    population although she may be good at it,  but does not seek the necessary
    training to move on. Her lifestyle has extra  limits that are self-imposed.
    She may be unconsciously angry at having to focus  on others, which shows in
    low-level grumbling about petty details. But her  philosophy pushed her to
    sacrifice. A change in modesty would break the role  she has lived so long
    and might endanger her marriage to a narcissist. All  these forces come
    together in keeping her the same.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, Lorrie’s need for  self-assertion is unexpressed. She may need
    <a name="page203"></a>psychotherapy  to define its risks and to help her
    decide if these are worth taking. But going  for therapy itself means
    breaking the self-sacrificing mold. Till then, she  goes on saying yes.
</p>
<p>
    Nick
</p>
<p>
    A position of strength can turn into weakness if  it grows rigid and fixed.
    This issue haunts Tillie, to be discussed later, and  Nick. Ordinarily, when
    behavior that once served us is outgrown, it is  discarded. Steps toward
    independence follow one another. As a first step Nick  said no to his
    controlling, frightening, and narcissistic father. Instead of  growing out
    of saying no, it metastasized against all desire. He became a  withholding
    person to self and others.
</p>
<p>
    This is the opposite of  Lorrie’s compliant yes to everything that pleases
    the other person. Nick’s no  deprived them and himself but was an act of
    hatred whose pleasure he did not  see. Being out of contact with the deeper
    meaning of our actions makes us  believe incomplete or incorrect
    interpretations of them. Lack of self-knowledge  keeps destructiveness
    alive. Nick lacked proper understanding and saw no reason  for his lunacy.
    He called it lunacy to be unwilling to do pleasurable and beneficial  things
    like sending out bills for services rendered.
</p>
<p>
    Saying no began in childhood  to parents who were utterly self-centered and
    demanded he always be on hand to  help. If he failed them in any way, they
    were furious. If he served them well,  another demand would follow. His
    father was the captain of a ship. At home and  on his pleasure boat, he
    would run his white-gloved hand on shelves to see if  they were clean. Nick
    cleaned the kitchen to pass inspection, repaired and  drove his father’s
    car, did endless household chores, and was demolished by his  father’s
    cruelty and humor.
</p>
<p>
    His parents gave him little  and expected a lot. They wanted to bask in his
    school achievements but gave him  no desk to work on. He used the dining
    table when it was free. Few of Nick’s  needs were attended to. His father’s
    needs always came first. Father had a boat  of his own to play with but
    could not afford a bedroom for his son, who camped  out in the living room.
    Nick was like a serf to his father, who had been raised  like a serf by his
    own distant relatives.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page204"></a>Nick  started to withdraw and withhold. He played
    hookey in the lower grades and  didn’t finish his final term in architecture
    school. He strolled away with a  nearly A average and can offer no
    explanation except, “I didn’t feel like it.”  Possessing considerable
    intelligence and talent, he alternately accepted and  rejected his father’s
    quest for greatness. Nick’s work was very good, when he  worked. Probably
    hatred for his parents caused him to drop out. In later years,  they boasted
    to guests about their “architect son,” for which he embarrassed  them by
    demurring. “I am not an architect.”
</p>
<p>
    Nick is so much tied to  dislike and resentment that he cannot see what he
    would like to do. All he  knows is hatred. When he went to see a therapist,
    he could not speak about what  bothered him. Raised by a vain and violent
    father, Nick’s jaws were  psychologically glued shut and he did not learn to
    open them. Feelings of spite  were expressed by not speaking.
</p>
<p>
    He treated his therapist as a  parent figure. The fearful child within him
    thought he could not speak but did  not know why. Nick also did not pay for
    all of his therapy bill. He said that  he did not earn enough to pay but
    spent money for entertainment. Hostility to  his father came out toward the
    therapist. Being broke allowed him to express  his need to be financially
    carried, which would not happen with his demanding  and narcissistic
    parents. Nick did not see the pleasure he derived from his  pain.
</p>
<p>
    After a while, the therapist  called a halt to unpaid treatment. He had not
    been able to analyze Nick’s  negative reaction, if indeed he saw it as such.
    Negative reaction is an  analytic phrase used to describe enjoyment of the
    imagined result of one’s  failure. Some people kill or attempt to kill
    themselves for such pleasure,  reveling in the fantasy of their relatives
    weeping with guilt. In therapy, a  negative reaction keeps you from getting
    better. You do not want to give the  therapist your improvement so that he
    or she can feel good about his work. Your  narcissistic parent would have
    boasted about what you accomplished with his  great genes and under his
    care. Your need to see the parent crushed is repeated  with the therapist as
    his stand-in. Your therapeutic failure brings down the  parent (or therapist
    as a parent substitute).
</p>
<p>
    Nick undermines himself but  labors for his friends. He paints their
    apartments and redesigns their  kitchens. He listens to their problems
    <a name="page205"></a>and drives a friend  to the hospital when she has a
    miscarriage. He shops for people, deriving the  infantile pleasure of
    pretending that he has endless funds. He helps them keep  their ships afloat
    as long as doing this does not interfere with letting his  own ship sink. If
    his friends want to do what he does not, he will not comply.  His definition
    of love involves a lot of sacrifice and little fun.
</p>
<p>
    A person devoted to not  achieving is in trouble. Nick’s self-deprivation
    has a tantrum quality. Living  to say no and withholding what he has to give
    show how closely he is tied to  his parents. Far better not to assign them
    so much power that their opinion  shakes him to the bone. Let them speak
    their minds and let him do what he  wants, whether it pleases them or not.
</p>
<p>
    In imagination if not in  fact, he strikes at them by surrendering his
    ambition. He cannot see that what  he does is voluntary. He complains, feels
    sad, depressed, and miserable, but  does not admit that he chooses to exist
    like this. If offered a way out, he  does not take it. If his life had more
    pleasure, he could note the difference.  With little pleasure and knowing
    the satisfaction of rejecting his parents’  needs, he does not assess the
    magnitude of what he does to himself. Chronically  depressed, he goes from
    pain to pain in the excitement of disappointing his  parents. Their
    emotional state occupies so much of his inner world that he does  not feel
    anything else. Parental pressures are everywhere and his self is  nowhere.
</p>
<p>
    If you ask Nick what he  wants, he does not know. If you ask him if he likes
    architectural design, in  which a licensed architect must sign his drawings,
    he says no. Abundant in  talent and experience, he says, “Why should I do a
    thing because I’m good at  it?” Life is cornered by the word no. He
    undercuts  his parents’ ambition but rebellion ties him to them. He upsets
    them by  refusing what they want. He makes promises he will not keep and no
    one can  control him. He is lonely but does not see that he can be closer to
    his  friends. He calls himself out of control.
</p>
<p>
    A life determined by  rejection means living on the rebound. Better to
    express anger in a different  way and be there for himself. Nick is arrested
    at the stage of saying no.  Pleasure in withholding keeps him in neurotic
    stasis. If he were more honest  with himself, he could not go on this way.
    Therapy with a new therapist, also  soon discarded, brought
    <a name="page206"></a>him to a greater love of life. He  sensed his anger at
    his father and the role anger played in his nonfunctioning.  He has found a
    woman who loves him and now has married. He has grown more  aggravated at
    not operating for his vocational good. He has started exercising.  As he
    becomes more active, he is confronted by the need to stop holding back.
    Although he denies the value of psychotherapy, his treatment of therapists
    shows how much rage he has and needs to deal with.
</p>
<p>
    Tillie
</p>
<p>
    In contrast to Nick’s self-denying negativism is  Tillie’s self-denying
    helpfulness. She takes a stand that runs counter to her  mother’s
    self-centered hatefulness. To not resemble Mother, she focuses on  others’
    needs. Phone calls, visits, most of her work contacts are treated as
    friends.  They believe this and subsequently act on it, leaving her barely a
    moment for  herself. Feeling overwhelmed by this, she wants to control
    people, which brings  her closer to her narcissistic mother’s behavior.
    Growth beyond this is  arrested because compulsive acceptance does not
    develop into action that  discriminates between people. There is no room for
    needs unrelated to giving.  Tillie is controlled by the desire to be unlike
    her mother.
</p>
<p>
    Compare Tillie and Lorrie.  They are helpful for opposite reasons. One
    became helpful to please herself and  one to please others. Lorrie was
    required to become helpful by a narcissistic  mother who revered a helper
    image. Tillie became helpful to be unlike her  suspicious and withholding
    narcissistic mother. Tillie’s understanding of  another’s misery is
    different from Lorrie’s. Tillie is less trained in  sacrifice and not as
    accepting of their weaknesses since it reminds her of the  state in which
    her mother tried to raise her. Since both are therapists, which  one is more
    helpful to a patient? It depends upon the patient’s need. Most of  all, a
    patient needs a therapist to be free of blind spots, the compulsion to  be
    and do. To the extent the therapist does not know if she is trapped, the
    patient will suffer. Both Tillie and Lorrie have significant blind spots
    about  themselves and in similar ways will be blind to their patients.
</p>
<p>
    Compare how Tillie and Nick  oppose their narcissistic parents.
    <a name="page207"></a>Tillie’s opposition  takes a positive approach and
    Nick’s a negative. To foil his narcissistic  parents, Nick says no to all
    desire. Tillie fights the control of her  narcissistic and paranoid mother
    by compulsively saying yes.
</p>
<p>
    Tillie’s mom thought she  could see right through people. She looked for
    evil and found it. Tillie found  her mother utterly self-centered, someone
    who used people to her advantage.  When Mother’s picture is taken she shows
    her knees. Not that she is sexual. Sex  is used to snare and hold a man. She
    superstitiously made preteen Tillie sit  bare-breasted in the sun to develop
    breasts so that she could later catch a  man. Mother had many odd illusions,
    which she imposed on her children. Tillie’s  older brother told his mother
    everything about himself, which later ended in  her attacking him. Brother’s
    tears alerted Tillie against such sharing. In this  family, Mother suffers
    and the child takes the blame.
</p>
<p>
    When Tillie moved out, Mother  saw rape lurking everywhere and would call to
    see if she had survived. Mother  tried to keep control and thought her
    judgment best. She panicked if her child  was not home by a certain time.
    Tillie saw her mother’s negative slant and  decided to be utterly unlike
    her. She would accept and trust all. If someone  needed help she gave it. If
    people behaved suspiciously, she saw them as  worthy. Once she found a
    wallet lying on the street and asked the person  standing next to her if he
    owned it. “Of course,” he said and took it from her  hand. Tillie’s power of
    judgment was suspended by her need for innocence. Her  mother was close to
    no one, including a seventy-year-old husband, and saved  money for the time
    that he would leave her. Tillie was close to all, attracting  them with
    smile and wit. She encouraged their demands and lived in a state of
    exhausted sainthood.
</p>
<p>
    By not looking at her needs  and disappointments, mistreatment of self
    continued. Her boyfriend promised a  trip that never arrived. He described a
    dreamy future on foreign shores but did  not work for it. His brilliance was
    in the puffery of speech. Nothing  materialized to support his schemes. She
    was not supposed to criticize him and  didn’t. He promised her great sunsets
    but wanted her to show him love by living  in his bedraggled mess, which she
    could ignore or clean. For him, showing  negative behavior tested her love.
    For her, loving him without limit disproved  her mother’s hatred of men.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page208"></a>Tillie’s  new strength of acceptance turned into
    weakness since her positive comments  were not tied to awareness of what she
    felt and knew. She was unrealistically  positive, a Santa Claus figure. One
    day, we were eating in a restaurant when a  woman came over whom Tillie
    hugged and complimented. Later she told me that she  could not remember who
    the woman was. This idea made me anxious. I want to be  loved by her as a
    friend because I am known. It upsets me to see her so free with  her hugs.
    She once told me that she thought me cold until she read some of my
    writing. I do not trust her profligate intimacy. She gives in an
    undiscriminating way. She is popular, but what does it mean if she says that
    she cares for me? Compulsive acceptance evades true intimacy. Intimacy is a
    matter of choice. Her mother avoided intimacy through suspicion and she
    avoids  it by being all-embracing.
</p>
<p>
    She was locked into “doing  good” when a new profession started to shake her
    loose. It was psychotherapy  with “clean” addicts and their families. Being
    able to tell them the truth has  to start with the self. Looking at her
    Pollyannaish approach birthed a new and  fragile phase in which she tries to
    know and care for herself and worries  whether this is narcissism.
    Counseling addicts keeps the pressure on. She needs  to be free to make
    decisions if she is to help codependent mates break free of  the compulsion
    to please their addicted mates.
</p>
<p>
    Living to please another is  codependent, even if it is undertaken by your
    own choice so as not to resemble  someone else. Tillie cannot help an addict
    to leave a self-destructive path if  she destroys herself with
    indiscriminate giving. She has to struggle with this  since even a
    preference for one thing over another causes her alarm. If all is  not
    equally good, has she become a rejecting person? Is she like her mother if
    she does not live to please?
</p>
<p>
    It was a sign of her growth  when she felt conflicted about a guest who
    stayed for the weekend. A sloppy and  angry person, he left his unwashed
    dishes in the sink. Tillie washed them and  later said to me that doing this
    was not good for his independence. She thought  of the damage done to him
    but not of its cost to her. The prospect of not being  self-sacrificial is
    contaminated by the memory of her mother’s selfishness. It  is hard for her
    to put herself first and to think it acceptable.
</p>
<p>
    In terms of development, she  has her toe on the next level, where
    <a name="page209"></a>she can allow herself  to be a real person with likes
    and dislikes, choices and preferences. At our  last meeting, she spoke of
    the self-destructive behavior of her boyfriend. She  no longer feels
    responsible for his fate but finds it hard to watch him destroy  himself by
    inches. Harder still to stay in an exclusive relationship with one  so
    destructive that she finds him physically unattractive and does not want him
    to fill her sexual needs. It would be good to remain his friend, perhaps to
    speak of her concern for him, but at the same time to find an appealing
    boyfriend who is not dependent, a man whom she wants to give her sexual
    pleasure.
</p>
<p>
    Alice
</p>
<p>
    Alice buries herself in her work and generally  has a nonexistent social
    life. She may date on vacation but otherwise has “no  time or energy” for
    it. She once dated a weak-willed man who liked her to be in  command.
    Although she did not enjoy his personality, his weakness did not  threaten
    her. It was years before she tired of knowing him, when feelings of  boredom
    led her to end the relationship. She feels safer practicing social
    distance. She would rather dominate a man and be bored than accept her
    mother’s  fate of being overwhelmed and controlled by a narcissistic
    husband. Like many  children of narcissists, she sees no other option than
    those practiced by her  parents.
</p>
<p>
    Between boyfriends and for  long periods of time, Alice stays alone. Social
    avoidance comes from an  estranged childhood in many countries, since her
    father constantly changed  jobs. Both parents were critical of any problem
    in their children and did not  support Alice through the anxiety of meeting
    new schoolmates and teachers.  Contact was doubtful with a distant father
    who acted her superior. Mother was a  frightened, hysterical woman who
    complained a lot and found her children’s  needs a burden. Alice avoided
    both parents’ disapproval by focusing on schoolwork.
</p>
<p>
    One time, in a Catholic  school assembly, she was pushed around by a nun who
    bore down on her for an  unknown crime. When she told her parents about
    this, they did not take her  side. From such treatment, she came to expect
    disloyalty and to mistrust love.  As a grownup she <a name="page210"></a>is
    often silent while others converse,  which drives them away or causes them
    to chat without addressing her. She fears  that her speech will turn people
    against her and in fact often has a  confronting tone like that of her
    father. This resemblance shows awe of his  authority as well as years of
    repressed fury that by identification with him  turned her submission into a
    bossy commanding facade. Isolation is the safest  way to go. The only person
    with whom she feels safe is her sister, a person who  she thinks understands
    her without speaking.
</p>
<p>
    In her first psychotherapy,  she said little and departed in a year or so,
    almost as unknown as when she  entered. This therapist respected her
    defensive constriction. In a more recent  psychotherapy, when lacking an
    external problem to discuss, she is at a loss  for words. If her therapist
    tries to discuss her closed-off state he is met by  misunderstanding. She
    feels attacked by his questions and responds with  rationalizations,
    arguments, and tears. She cannot be objective about her  silence because it
    offers her protection. Years of defensiveness have brought  her to the
    defense of denying her inner life. She is not committed to marking a  path
    to where she hides, let alone to changing her route to safety.
</p>
<p>
    Alice needs to become  acquainted with her inner self. She has too long shut
    it out in fear of social  censure. She needs to know her anger, of which she
    has an abundance. She also  has to know her need for love. Living with so
    much anger and fear, she is not  much troubled by social needs and stays
    away from thoughts that would reveal  them to her. Much of her affection
    goes to animals and to her sister. That  Alice was expert at attacking her
    parents to get them to support her siblings  is no reason to think herself
    hopelessly unlovable. Personal change will mean  knowing her fears and then
    what she desires. As with most children of  narcissistic parents, she has
    the undertaking of finding out what holds her  back.
</p>
<p>
    Doryan
</p>
<p>
    If you become a slave to refusal, you are glued  to rebellion and unable to
    find out what your self needs. The people described  thus far live mostly
    for or against another person. Let us look at one whose  growth
    <a name="page211"></a>went further and turned him toward his self. Doryan
    broke free of the narcissistic mold to follow his own mind. When I asked
    him,  “What special strength came out of freeing yourself from your
    narcissistic  home?” he said, “To find out for myself. Never to accept
    anyone’s word on an  issue. To break through to my own understanding.”
</p>
<p>
    More than most people with  narcissistic roots, he makes it on his own. He
    serves many but needs few. His  strength goes out to public issues. His
    weakness is hidden in his private life.  He is very strong in his public
    actions and somewhat limited and weak in  private. In all he does, he is an
    individual. He is ruled by the need not to  submit to outside pressure.
</p>
<p>
    He was raised in Europe by  narcissistic parents who told him what to do.
    First there were parents, then  governesses and tutors, then parents again.
    He shrank from all, looking through  the eyes of his camera. He wrote plays
    and studied lizards and bugs. Developing  an inner world was necessary for
    one who was subjected to what his parents  thought of as “the best.”
</p>
<p>
    One summer, when he was about  fourteen, Doryan visited an aunt and uncle
    who were vacationing at a northern  European lake resort. There were too
    many people for his pleasure so he climbed  into a canoe and paddled off.
    The more he paddled the quieter the shore and the  more beautiful the scene.
    This trip brought him joy and launched him on a  search for wilderness. His
    family did not much protest his move since he had a  mountaineering uncle
    who explored. Uncle modeled activities that his parents  did not find
    altogether strange.
</p>
<p>
    In his teens, his area of  expertise was acrobatics, at which he worked to
    overcome a small and slim  stature. He was one for trying to win any
    contest, although competitiveness did  not mean that much to him. It was a
    way of existing. Still, disappointment came  from receiving unfair
    treatment. Like being first in a language course and  seeing the reward
    given to a lesser student who was older and therefore thought  more
    appropriate for the prize of a trip. Or when his mother promised him a
    spendable sum for an excellent report card. He studied hard and got A’s,
    except  for singing. She held back the prize because of his grade in voice.
    He felt  cheated by this and his studying ceased. When he found treatment
    unfair, he  would stop his activities. He was able to withdraw, a good
    defense against the invasion  of narcissistic parents. All this led him to
    be on his own.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page212"></a>His  parents talked Doryan out of studying biology so
    he entered engineering. Due to  family pressure, he was in his junior year
    at high school and engineering  school at the same time. Aside from this, he
    resisted. He knew he had to make a  living and the rest was up to him. He
    paid for boat rentals out of limited  earnings and was a student between
    exploratory jaunts. At age eighteen he  emigrated to the United States.
    Education went on. So did voyaging. His trips  went farther north until he
    traded canoe for kayak, a covered boat for bad  weather and blustery water.
    He made voyages down rivers never mapped and became  an expert on survival.
    He catalogued the Arctic life, its flora and fauna, the religious  shrines
    and bones of those who were left behind. He rested his eyes on wild  things
    in the natural state, like butterflies with hairy wings in the Arctic
    summer.
</p>
<p>
    He tried not to disturb  animal life and carried no weapon except for a wasp
    spray, thinking that a gun  gives too much superiority. A wasp spray had not
    been used against the polar  bears but he assumed that they’d take notice if
    he sprayed their sensitive  noses. A bear once stalked him while he was
    sitting on a rock waiting for his  plane. Since the trip was over, he had
    put his gear away, including the wasp  spray. The plane arrived shortly
    before the bear, which the people on board had  seen but he had not. They
    were wild with excitement as they pulled him into the  plane.
</p>
<p>
    Wanting to be the animals’  witness and guest, Doryan would fit in as he
    never could in his parents’  narcissistic home. He did what he could without
    mechanical help and was sad at  being physically small, which led to further
    development of strength and  special skills. He did as much as anyone, if
    not more. It was his mind, not the  facts, that called him too small. The
    child of a narcissist is always too small  for them. Doryan went where only
    rare beings can go and survive. He developed  hardiness and scholarliness
    with a keen mind that harked to the simplest of  elements. What he did with
    his energy is helpful to the world of exploration  and preservation.
</p>
<p>
    Doryan leads small groups by  kayak to the rare beauty of that desert we
    call the Arctic. He gives lectures  about exploration and lowers his voice
    when he walks with people in the wild.  He gives lessons on how to fit in,
    looking at stems and roots to see how things  grow through time, witnessing
    the cracking of stones under ages of freezing and  melting. He has the gift
    of being in nature that comes <a name="page213"></a>to  one raised in
    submission to the throne of a narcissistic family.
</p>
<p>
    He is a man of strong mind  who tries to understand and will not be led. He
    does engineering for a living  but nature is his love. He has amazing
    biological knowledge and his thought is  penetrating about natural things.
    It changes when you get to his topic of fear,  the emotional why of human
    relations. He is uncomfortable and puzzled when I  ask him why he does
    something interpersonal. In nature he sees a multiplicity  of causes, things
    meshing and progressing out of one another. In viewing his  self he avoids
    the emotional determinant. He is socially undeveloped, avoiding  the
    intimacy where others try, fail, learn from their mistakes, and try again.
    He says that his parental home and his marriage, which was painfully
    unsuccessful, were too upsetting to want another “experiment.” Instead, he
    focuses on his interests and keeps his distance, even from his kids, hoping
    that he will be loved as he is, deeply loved but not seen too often.
</p>
<p>
    He says he does not suffer  emotional consequences from his physical
    mishaps. He only asks what he can do  in response to such crises as a
    freezing spill into an Arctic river. Like the  Möbius strip, one of his
    favorite forms, his thought has no top and no bottom,  no beginning and no
    end. Möbius is a twisted figure, like the symbol of  eternity. Like a Möbius
    strip, Doryan must be taken as he is.
</p>
<p>
    Does he miss his lover when  they are apart? He told me that he does in the
    protective pain of his heart’s  isolation. He feels empty without her but if
    he thinks about what is missing,  his mind is too divided and frightened to
    change. He will not test closeness,  seeing if he is as weak as he fears, as
    weak as he was with his narcissistic  parents. He sticks to his freedom and
    must be alone. He gets together with his  girlfriend as a break in his
    “important affairs.” Then he goes away and there  is little sign for her of
    an ongoing tie. She feels very cut off when they are  apart. He does not
    hesitate to have many women friends and some casual lovers.  All are a means
    of reducing intimacy with the woman he loves.
</p>
<p>
    Constant breaks are his  protection. In therapy he became able to say no to
    his widowed narcissistic  mother, who had a stranglehold on his emotional
    life. He moved out of her  apartment and left therapy with the closeness
    issue unresolved. The therapist  offered intellectual information to him but
    they formed no emotional tie. He  says that the therapist admired Doryan’s
    ability to live through any difficulty  and <a name="page214"></a>stand it
    alone. I think he has always stood alone. What  Doryan did not hear was the
    weakness side of this equation.
</p>
<p>
    What he gave to his children  and now his girlfriend is his emotional “max.”
    He is afraid to delve into  self-knowledge more deeply. He lacks motivation
    to change and calls himself too  old. He now has reached seventy but has the
    resiliency of an arctic explorer.  What if they get together and “the
    experiment fails,” which then will leave him  without his friends. He talks
    as if an eligible man is ever without company. He  has many excuses that are
    constantly changing … too something … young-old-poor-busy  to try getting
    close. He fears the extremes of closeness and distance. His fear  of
    closeness with people verges on the phobic. What if his lover or friend gets
    a narcissistic hold on him? Freedom is his primary concern. When asked who
    his  friends are, he says that he has few, but mainly associates. His
    closest friend  is his girlfriend.
</p>
<p>
    This child of a narcissist  gained strength from freeing his physical self
    from narcissistic parents but  still has troubling connections with them. He
    fears that the power his parents  had to run his life will reappear in the
    one he loves and she will take him  over. His intellectual life has so much
    interest and value that he wants to  live with his deficiencies and not to
    change himself further. He is afraid of  getting close to a woman because
    what if he grows old in the relationship and  then finds himself alone
    again. This is partly a rationalization. A man can  usually find new
    girlfriends. The associations which Doryan enjoys do not have  the pains and
    pleasures of an intimate love affair.
</p>
<p>
    In closeness, this intrepid  explorer is ruled by fear. One cannot see his
    future. Currently there is  insufficient motivation to change, perhaps
    because his fear is too great. Let  us hope that something will nurture his
    roots and cause him to grow, that  motivation will come. Overall, he is a
    man of rare achievement and strength  grown out of the struggle to separate
    from constricting, narcissistic parents.
</p>
<p>
    Elan
</p>
<p>
    An idea about changing the self is slow in  rooting. Not being narcissistic
    does not mean that one should be a slave. For  the narcissist there is only
    self. For the normal person, there is self and  other. If we were
    <a name="page215"></a>not born only to serve or take, how much  care or
    self-care is reasonable and how much do we need? Strength comes from
    considering  you and me. Weakness consists of being trapped in caring for
    only one or none.
</p>
<p>
    The struggle we take to  achieve identity is an interesting one. After
    childhood with narcissistic  parents we need to follow our instincts. These
    lead us to our selves and teach  us that it/I exists. Mundane approaches
    imply following other people’s rules, a  practice of which we have had
    enough. Wanting to develop, our struggle often  takes us down unusual paths.
</p>
<p>
    Self-development is difficult  if the sense of self is undermined. Where and
    what is that devalued self? If we  are overly discouraged we lose the desire
    to look and try, fall to a low level  of despair, or hang out in neutral and
    are unknown. We go to extremes of  conformity with or rebellion against
    another’s opinion. As a youth, I was too  confused to do anything but
    conform, but lacked a clear image of what to  conform to. My narcissistic
    parents were rebels and attacked anyone else’s  thoughts and ideas,
    including each other’s. For example, one said cut your  hair, the other said
    grow it. One said I read too little, the other said too  much. When I
    complained about loneliness, my father said I cared too much for  people,
    etc. They did what they thought was right regardless of majority  opinion
    and often were in mutual opposition, which made my position even more
    confusing.
</p>
<p>
    They said, “Resemble me,” but  opposed each other and neither gave a clear
    image to follow. My father wanted  to be the more omnipotent one, the chief,
    but his image was vague. My mother  was so unique and clear that I lacked
    the courage to be like her even if I felt  that she was right, which I did
    not, having been taught to disapprove by my  dad.
</p>
<p>
    I did not know what I was  supposed to become. My appearance was generally
    “wrong,” but what was right? I  begged for a fuschia satin jacket like the
    one worn by other kids but my father  was opposed. He said that I was not
    supposed to resemble “them.” What should I  look like? When my mother
    opposed him and bought the jacket, I already felt so  different that it was
    more like a disguise than an outfit that joined me with  the others. At a
    time when adolescents try to look alike and hang out together,  I felt and
    looked the oddball <a name="page216"></a>and hung out alone. When the  girls
    stayed together, I accompanied the boys and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
    Kids want friends but my  father insisted that one friend was enough. I
    accepted this since I found  making friends so difficult and had been raised
    to feel the outsider. I entered  college feeling hopeless, especially in the
    face of so much company. Adding to my  shock, the college looked upon my
    supposedly low ability with favor, which made  my depression worse. What if
    they were only fooled and later saw the real and  inadequate me?
</p>
<p>
    Success drove me to therapy,  especially being made editor of the school
    magazine. I could not live with the  inconsistency between their image of me
    and mine and dropped out of editing. I  graduated and, after floundering for
    a while, went to graduate school in  clinical psychology. While this went
    on, another part of me was developing while  I studied about and traveled in
    Asia, which I describe in Chapter 14.
</p>
<p>
    In the part of Asia where I  resided, every woman wore a skirt that covered
    her legs. I hiked in trousers,  but when living in a village wore a
    calf-length blue cotton jumper with a long-sleeved  white blouse. It was
    commonly worn, distinctly Tibetan, and handmade. When I  returned to the
    States, having been away so long, I wore it still. I felt at  home in my
    Tibetan dress, having grown accustomed to it in a place where I was  more
    accepted than anywhere else, a mountain home where I could leave my wallet
    unmolested on the trail.
</p>
<p>
    Asia is good for a person  inquiring into who she is. Asia has more to do
    with manifesting the inner self  than does the outer-directed and
    self-conscious West. Outside Darjeeling, I  lived in a house shared by
    people who were studying Tibetan meditation. My  mountain friends included
    Tibetans who had sat through three years, three  months, and three days of
    isolated meditation. They had wonderful humor. I  remember their laughing
    over difficulties that would have made me cry, like the  time we gave them
    an increase in beans to improve their protein intake and they  stood on line
    all night waiting for the latrine.
</p>
<p>
    After Asia, I had to learn  how to fit into society without abandoning my
    emerging sense of self. I had to  determine what was important and figure
    out how to preserve it. I returned to  the West in my classical Tibetan
    robes and was told that I looked like a  Chinese aristocrat
    <a name="page217"></a>of the fifteenth century. To me I looked  nice. After
    years of passive acquiescence, I had entered a stage of  self-assertion.
    Looking unusual did not make me want to change my dress. I  looked like
    everyone in the part of the world from which I had just come. My  outfit was
    a step into independence.
</p>
<p>
    I took the assertiveness of  dress further. Between the times I wore my
    Tibetan dress and mood, I began to  wear miniskirts with fishnet stockings.
    I hated my job, which required I learn  computer programming and insurance
    math for a stodgy insurance company. The  complaints I received about my
    stockings barely registered above my anxiety and  annoyance with computer
    math. Flow charts were used to delineate my weekend. On  them appeared
    office tasks as given by my boss “Alphonse Cohen.” I gave him the  name
    “Cohenballmaus,” my way of showing his quest for power and underlying
    timidity. This timidity did not stop him from firing me because I still wore
    my  fishnets. They knew from my dress that I would not fit in. I knew from
    my math  that it was so. Still, I learned from this that one does not need
    to dress to  proclaim originality. I also learned not to work at what I
    hate.
</p>
<p>
    Strategy was a new concept  for me. I had been raised to believe that my
    father could read my thoughts and  that nothing I could think or do would
    change his mind. After much discussion  in therapy of my dress, I recognized
    when I fit in and when I stuck out. From  the way people treated me, I saw
    that I could be more outspoken if I dressed in  inoffensive mufti. I was
    beginning to stand for what I believed in, but not to  be compelled to cause
    unnecessary trouble.
</p>
<p>
    Years later, I seek the  original because it pleases me. I don’t feel
    compelled to be different but  prefer it. I have some of the strength that
    was nourished by my struggle to be  free of the dominance of narcissistic
    parents.
</p>
<p>
    The next step in  psychological growth has to do with knowing what can be
    changed and how to ask  for it. It has to do with not staying with what does
    not satisfy. The child of  a narcissist is often hungry and waiting. We need
    to break our identification  with the parent and not attempt to change what
    cannot be changed. If what is  offered is insufficient and unchangeable,
    move on. Life is a classroom. We are  left back until we understand the
    lesson. There is always a more difficult  lesson ahead.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page218"></a>Helpful Approaches to Change
</p>
<p>
    A sense of self develops from interaction with  people and from deeds that
    set you on the road. A person trips over his feet  and laughs to discover
    the error of his ways. Do you know what you need and  what you have to
    offer, what you can and cannot do? Are there people who rely  on
    “inadequate” you and seem to enjoy it? We can feel hopelessly confused,
    wonderfully good and horribly bad at the same time since the parent put our
    ideal image on a pedestal and our ordinary self in a ditch. If we throw
    caution  to the winds and do the best we can, we find trying to live up to
    the  narcissist image of being a perfect person to be a waste of time.
</p>
<p>
    All this has to do with  knowing our buried selves, so far out of range that
    sometimes we feel  nonexistent at the core and strangely empty. Are we
    centerless and different  from other people? Can something unfelt exist? Can
    a self grow out of  emptiness?
</p>
<p>
    Psychotherapy can be very  helpful, but what we call therapy can come from
    ordinary people who see, hear,  and feel us. It comes from friends and
    relatives, from fortunate encounters  with strangers like the Rabbit Man and
    the man who helped Irwin to his feet.  When we are afraid of doing something
    lest we fail, we meet someone who loves  the doing and shares it. To have
    such experience we must take the risk of doing  or at least of being around
    a doer. We think that our families’ ways are the  only ways and then we meet
    people with entirely different values. Like a Korean  family of
    acupuncturists that has so much joy in helping others and an  outrageous
    sense of humor. From the happiness in their voices and the pleasure  in
    their eyes, you know their way is good.
</p>
<p>
    You think that you are odd,  for example, in your sexual preferences or in
    what you call love. Your parents  always treated you that way. Then you
    attend an art show that features what you  think of as horrible and a host
    of self-accepting practitioners are  represented. You realize that you have
    overreacted and misjudged yourself and that  staying in isolation brings
    misunderstanding. The greatest source of hatred for  yourself, regardless of
    what others say, comes from you.
</p>
<p>
    You think that you are  without value and are driven to write it down. It
    turns into a story that you  read in a writing group. People talk
    <a name="page219"></a>to you about it and  your writing. You begin to see
    that there is a valuable life inside.
</p>
<p>
    Formal Psychotherapy
</p>
<p>
    Since the reflecting mirror of our mind is  stained with our parents’ views,
    how can we see ourselves? Where and how can we  see ourselves at all? We
    need a reliable mirror in which to look, to be  accepted as we are to
    achieve a sense of being. For many, the therapist is the  one with whom we
    first can be ourselves. The therapist should be a reasonable  person free of
    pressure for us to achieve his wishes and fulfill his values. He  should be
    one with whom we can disagree.
</p>
<p>
    Group therapy is often  useful. In group we show ourselves to others and
    learn how we affect them. Out  of our terror, we learn to speak our minds.
    We start to feel our temper. Always  having heard our parents’ distorted
    opinions, foreign perspective is helpful.  We learn that we can differ and
    go on.
</p>
<p>
    After hearing their responses  to us, group members seek our wisdom in
    return. We find that we have identities  of our own. We recognize that not
    everything we do, especially what we have  learned from our parents, is
    socially useful. Our notion of narcissistic  perfection crumbles. With
    growing awareness, we can offer useful comments and  feelings. We learn that
    there is someone inside us.
</p>
<p>
    At times, we may think that  the therapist is mistreating us in narcissistic
    ways. If this is our  transference, it shows the experiences that a grown
    child carries from her  past. Transference means experiencing and having
    feelings about a current  person in the same way that we did about an
    important person in our early  childhood. Although the resemblance is
    illusory, transference causes us to  relive ancient expectations, wishes,
    feelings, and attitudes and offers the  opportunity to examine them and to
    change them if needed. Of course, it is only  transference if the therapist
    is not narcissistic. Narcissistic parents say  that we should be perfect,
    and that they are entitled to a form of worship.  Such concepts paralyze us.
    What if I do something and do it poorly. Is the  therapist criticizing me?
    Or is it me thinking that it is in his mind? I  remember my personal hell of
    tennis lessons, agony to be <a name="page220"></a>a  beginner. I imposed my
    feelings about the situation onto myself, confusing the  “it” of my practice
    with the value of my being.
</p>
<p>
    Self is not the product of a  propaganda machine. It has its own needs and
    identity. If never felt, self’s  arrival can give a shocking jolt. For years
    of therapy, I wept over all the  things that I was missing. The world would
    never accept me with my “small”  brain and breasts. My narcissistic parents
    had declared me unable to love so I  saw my cause as hopeless. Psychotherapy
    helped me look at the facts as well as  my dreams and fantasies. In my
    current problems I had been reliving the issues  of early life. I began to
    see my neurotic expectations and to stagger over  blind spots. Therapy
    opened my eyes so that I could look another way.
</p>
<p>
    I looked into my memory of  the past. Had there been any freedom to be
    myself? Inside my head, I hear my father  attacking my need for independence
    and hating the therapist for presumably  being against him. My memories
    offer more to me than this—many of them are sad,  some of them are hopeful.
    They show me what I care for. A narcissistic parent  often applies restraint
    before his child is capable of understanding. It is  hard to distinguish
    what was introduced into an atmosphere that always existed.  You tend to
    think that is the “way it is.”
</p>
<p>
    Many think they should  deliberately replace the parent’s views with a new,
    untested image but this is  covering self with another false identity. To
    avoid false identity we should  not bury our emptiness under rocks of
    nonbeing. How are we to know the self  long buried, so far out of range that
    we feel nonexistent? Can a self unfelt  exist?
</p>
<p>
    For me a great jolt came  after years of expressing unhappiness in therapy.
    I was talking about something  when emotion welled up inside me. My
    therapist interrupted what I was saying to  ask me what I felt. I spoke of
    it with confusion. I did not know what it was  until he called it love.
    Imagine my joy. If I could feel love then I was  lovable. Years of declaring
    myself emotionally void were at an end.

<p>
    We need to stop acting like sponges to our parents’ negative opinions.  They
    will try to push us in narcissistic ways but what they tell us need not
    determine how we feel. We are demolished by such comments if we accept them
    as  valid and take our errors as signs of inner worthlessness. We feel
    guilty for rejecting  their view of us if we think loving them means to
    believe all they say. We need  to see ourselves as we are and not the
    picture that our parents paint of us. If  in some ways we fit their negative
    descriptions, that behavior can be changed.
</p>
<p>
    If we want to be treated in a  different way, the change in treatment must
    start with how we present ourselves  to them. This problem
    <a name="page223"></a>was present in full glory during a  weekend country
    visit by my father and his wife. I again experienced what  narcissism can
    make me feel. Not having seen each other for months, he greeted  me with his
    standard opening, a negative aesthetic evaluation. This approach  was one
    that filled my childhood, an approach in which body and mind were on  trial.
</p>
<p>
    Stepping over the threshold,  he went into his act, holding me at arm’s
    length for a physical reading that  was characteristically negative. He
    frowned at me and said, “Your eyes are  swollen. You look tired.” Already a
    double dose of what my doubtful self-image  didn’t want to hear. I responded
    with, “I stroked a cat and probably rubbed my  eyes. I’m allergic to cats.”
    This offered him a new beachhead to conquer. “You  should have known better
    than to do a thing like that.” His tone and words  implied that I was
    stupid, weak, and thoughtless. To some extent I took it. It  is hard to be
    sensitive around a parent who always rubs in your problems.
</p>
<p>
    I defensively changed the  topic to my strength. I was responding to his
    judgment as if it carried great  importance and was indirectly fighting
    back. “I am going on a three-mile run.  Will you join me?” To this his guns
    took a new position. “At your age, make it  a mile and a half.” Did this
    cautionary note apply to him or me? Narcissists  often confuse identities
    with their children. “Can you run three miles?” I asked  again and he
    returned to, “At your age …”
</p>
<p>
    Having to announce the  distance of my run shows that his comments hurt me.
    It would have been  healthier to have run and let him have his opinion.
    Being oversensitive to  critical comments is the frequent weakness of
    children of narcissists. We can  work on our hypersensitivity by seeing who
    does the judging and by knowing that  everyone has shortcomings.
</p>
<p>
    I don’t like being treated as  a puny child and can’t stand negative
    opinions because I haven’t sufficiently separated  my self-evaluation from
    the critic’s. In this context, my analyst told me a  story about Charlie
    Parker. His band expected him to come and play but he was  too drugged to
    get out of bed. Finally they went to get him and dragged him to  rehearsal.
    He sat there in silence while the band played through many of his  choruses.
    Finally, he lifted his saxophone and played a single note. A  narcissist
    would have disregarded that note—
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page224"></a>“Worthless  without …”—but a famous musician who was
    present said, “What a note that was.”
</p>
<p>
    I see how I was overly  defended because I did not know the proper response
    to their demeaning  comments. My father’s wife felt too weak to assist with
    the luggage so I went  out to help carry things from the car. I had his
    typewriter in one hand and a  bag of vegetables in the other, to which he
    said, “Give me that. It’s too heavy  for you.” I held on and moved away,
    half inviting him to wrestle. I walked off,  feeling more the weight of his
    judgment than his luggage. He followed me with  acerbic comments. “You’re as
    crazy as my ninety-year-old father was.” Grandpa  was big, a man known for
    religious pressure but very kind to me. I would join  him at prayer in a
    tongue I did not know. On the harvest holiday, we would  shake a lemon and a
    sheaf of wheat. He was Russian and always kissed me hello  on the lips. This
    man I loved.
</p>
<p>
    Linking me with a man both  ancient and decrepit is supposed to make me
    weak. But does his putting me in  his father’s image make me weak? Dad is
    feeling old and passing on the trait. Then  comes the narcissism of his
    wife. I enter the house with their luggage, change  into my sweat pants, and
    am ready to run. His wife is sitting on the couch and  looking at me hard.
    She seems to have become more like him when she says, “You  aren’t skinny
    anymore.” She is alluding to the great amount of weight I lost  while
    recovering from a concussion. Her tone is not complimentary. Weight is a
    point about which I am vulnerable since I used to eat compulsively when I
    felt  self-hatred or depression. Once you are fat, you always feel fat
    regardless of  your size.
</p>
<p>
    The sequence of events during  this weekend shows me why I overeat. “I wear
    a size eight. Do you think I’m  fat?” She says no and retreats from an
    argumentative scene. In the back of my  mind, I know that she has a problem
    with weight. Her daughter is very skinny,  as are her daughter’s children.
    The family seems to share a need to be thin.  She has focused even more on
    weight since her recent gain of thirty pounds.  Trying to get her to take it
    off, my father verbally attacks her for every  extra pound. He clings to a
    controlling and judgmental position.
</p>
<p>
    I tell him, “I’m ready to  run. Would you like to join me?” He holds us
    back, embarking on a lengthy  search for the right kind of shirt. Then he
    joins me for his walk-run, which I  accompany, kicking high in the
    <a name="page225"></a>back to make up for our slow  pace. He talks and I see
    more deeply into why he speaks to me in a demeaning  way. “Can you imagine
    an eighty-three-, almost eighty-four-year-old running  like this?” It is
    narcissistic to change his evaluation of aging to suit  himself. His father
    was crazy to act strong at ninety but he is terrific for  running at
    eighty-four. Praise to him and blame to me. He is more critical of  me
    because his self-esteem is low. Aging is hard for the narcissist. Some of my
    annoyance dissipates. But annoyance is not the entire story. The criticism
    that  was given stays with me and has its effect. When he slows down to a
    walk and  turns around, I take the rest of the distance in a solitary run.
</p>
<p>
    When I get back, I invite my  father to go for a swim, to which he responds,
    “Invite a man of your own to  swim.” I answer, “Sorry I invited you,” but
    should have said, “I shall have one  as soon as I am ready.” My father
    increased my feelings of loneliness in an  unresolved situation with a
    boyfriend who needs a lot of separation. Father’s  lack of sympathy arouses
    my pain and embarrassment. Later he adds, “That man  treats you as his
    concubine. He sleeps with you but will not take you  anywhere.” I have been
    very unhappy about his keeping me from the doings of his  active life. But
    then again, he sees his kids and grandchild rarely and has no  close
    friends. He fills his life with acquaintances and socially useful work.
    Still, my father’s words sink in and misery replaces the memory I have of
    many  happy hours my boyfriend and I have spent together. I forget that he
    often says  he loves me, and it is true.
</p>
<p>
    Later that week, there is a  telephone argument with my mother in which I
    tell her that something she has  done resembles what my dad would do. Being
    compared to the man she has divorced  and hates drives her into a temper.
    She writes me a letter in which she says  that he never paid a cent of the
    agreed-upon child support and that she was too  proud to ask him for it. She
    says that he was demanding and inattentive to her  sexually, far more
    concerned with his own satisfaction than with her pleasure.  She only found
    real satisfaction years later with a boyfriend. She summed up  with, “Your
    father treated me like a concubine.”
</p>
<p>
    There is that word again and  it was independently introduced. I see that my
    father attributes to my  boyfriend his own view of women. They are hollow,
    tubes for him to invade with  his organ and his words.
    <a name="page226">
    </a>
    No wonder he used to say that the  best woman was a Japanese geisha. A
    geisha is a beautiful and delicate woman  who serves men while walking
    lightly in paper slippers.
</p>
<p>
    I saw the effect of his  criticism of my appearance in my behavior the
    following day. I was overeating  to damage the beauty that they denied me,
    enacting the inadequate image that  both of them projected. Overeating had
    troubled me in previous years. Now I saw  some of the reason for its being.
    I overate to show respect for their criticism  of my weight. If I want to
    help myself, I can refuse to please them by becoming  what is not good for
    me.
</p>
<p>
    I also was troubled by my  father’s evaluation of my boyfriend and brought
    the issue to therapy. My  therapist said, “Your boyfriend loves you as much
    as he is able but not enough  for you.” The therapist is not implying that
    my needs are too great in general,  but only for this man. I hear his words
    and understand, but as soon as the  session is over it starts again, my
    feeling of despair at not being loved.
</p>
<p>
    Like many children of  narcissists, I automatically gravitate toward the
    negative. Long demeaned by  our parents, we feel hideously unworthy if there
    is no one who loves us and in  whose love we believe. Without love to
    contradict the parents’ message, their  opinions and treatment rule how we
    feel. I told my therapist that his pointing  out how unloved I felt made me
    feel hopeless about my ability to benefit from  therapy, to which he
    responded by further showing me how I caused myself pain.  Belief in my
    parents’ view makes me feel unworthy of love. In support of this belief,  I
    take my boyfriend’s limitation as evidence of my unlovability. I act as if
    he  could give more love to another woman and twist unrelated information to
    use  against myself. My father’s words are used like an emotional knife that
    I  thrust into my heart.
</p>
<p>
    If I accept my parent’s  vision of me as unworthy, I will have trouble
    getting along with him. On this  weekend with Father and spouse, criticism
    is adding up to a heap that  infuriates. When his wife says that she cannot
    stand this country place because  there are no people to do things with, I
    respond to her in a narcissistic way,  an error that adds fire to fire. I
    criticize her inability to spend time with  herself. Acting narcissistic is
    a common failing for children of narcissists.  The parent’s desire to
    control me brings me to try to control them in the <a
    name="page227"></a>same way. I say, “Why don’t you use the time to paint?
    You  always say that is what you want to do.” She angrily responds, “I need
    a  teacher to help me do it,” and I come back with, “Why must there always
    be  another person in everything you do?” In sharing their critical
    technique I  make the habit stronger since my doing it means that this
    approach is OK.
</p>
<p>
    I remind myself that what  they say is only an opinion. Children of
    narcissists are surprised to see that  their parents do not fit the image of
    a superman or superwoman who won’t repeat  an error (or make one in the
    first place). Belief in the parents’ “perfection”  makes it hard to
    generalize from known limitations. It is better to know our  parents’
    fallibility. Then their negative words do not sink so deep. My parents  talk
    of happily married people and advise me to follow suit. Divorces and
    unhappy marriages come to mind so that I can think, What is wrong with
    living  the life that I think suits me?
</p>
<p>
    If I want them to talk to me  in a nonnarcissistic way, I will have to do
    the same to them. I could have  responded to his wife’s complaints about
    loneliness with, “When I return from  the city, I would like to see one of
    your paintings.” This is a request and not  a command. A proper approach has
    no accusation. It supports a voluntary spirit.  If she paints, it is for her
    pleasure.
</p>
<p>
    My therapist told a story  that exemplified not being swept into a competing
    ego trip. In a band all but  one of the musicians were playing very loudly.
    To “achieve balance,” they  wanted the soft one to raise his volume. He
    didn’t like it loud and lowered his  volume instead. The band grew angry but
    could not make him get louder. Instead,  they had to lower their sound to
    achieve balance.
</p>
<p>
    We need to learn how to get  out from under parental pressure without
    declaring war. After years of  criticism from a narcissistic family,
    children accept what they hear and are  plagued by low self-esteem. We grow
    older and develop independent ideas, but  still fall prey to doing what our
    parents like. Then we get stronger still and  are sad, mad, and no longer
    willing to tolerate manipulation. When they tell us  who we are and what to
    do, we fly into tantrums and counteraccuse. Although we  rebel against what
    they say, this reaction shows that we are not autonomous.
</p>
<p>
    I had many angry moments on  my parents’ visit, which showed
    <a name="page228"></a>that in some way I believed  their opinions. When his
    wife asked if she could hold a family party in my  house, she was pleasing
    my father while bringing inconvenience to me. Knowing  of my emotional
    distance from these narcissistic relatives, she was going to  get us all
    together and pour on the glue. Because her party would interfere  with my
    work, I said an angry no. Later, I realized that if I had felt less
    threatened, I could have said, “Do what you like,” joined the party for a
    while, gone for a run, and retired to my room with my ears plugged against
    sound to work.
</p>
<p>
    How do I feel about my  response to them? Overall, too sensitive. I see how
    I learned to hate my face  and figure and that it is hard for me to treat
    demeaning remarks as comments to  be evaluated. Trained to feel inadequate,
    objectivity is a hurdle I will have  to practice jumping. My father is as
    fallible as any. When I am hurt by what he  says, I must have forgotten
    this.
</p>
<p>
    How to react to unacceptable  comments and suggestions? If you are inured to
    inherent attack, say in a  friendly tone, “Interesting opinion; I shall
    consider it.” Consider it in your  own time and when you are ready. If your
    parent demands agreement now, say that  you need time to think it over. Do
    not be bullied into agreeing in order to  still his or her insecurity. Do
    not defer to critical manipulation by  projecting a state of awe. An
    attacked child cringes, cries, argues, and feels  inferior. Outgrow this and
    treat criticism as a suggestion you will consider.
</p>
<p>
    Give what is said the respect  you reserve for any kind of comment. Do this
    even if you are hypersensitive. If  you want to agree or disagree, say what
    you will and let your comments rest.  Avoid combat no matter how unruly or
    insulting the response. Your life does not  depend on other people’s opinion
    of you. Children of narcissists are so much  criticized that they accept
    criticism everywhere and train new people to speak  to them that way. But
    criticism should be stopped as early as possible.  Destructive criticism is
    not a pattern to encourage. If an older child or adult  cannot accomplish
    this in his family home, he needs to move out as soon as  possible.
</p>
<p>
    Practice noncombative firmness.  Do not support a critical approach by
    falling on your knees. If you hear  remarks that cause you to worry, seek
    outside evaluation. You may need to  change something but don’t want to feed
    the critical method a meal of grandeur.  A narcissistic
    <a name="page229">
    </a>
    man criticized everyone because his approach  was never stopped. He was told
    fifty thousand times not to criticize but  criticism remained his calling.
    If reprimanded, he would say, “I’m sorry you  took it that way.” Nothing
    stayed his tongue.
</p>
<p>
    An effective way to deal with  compulsive criticism is to ignore what is
    said. Do not fuss about its put-down  quality. The compulsive critic relies
    on your attention to feed his ego. If you  remonstrate, argue, deny, feel
    hurt, you show that his comments hit home. Such  a reaction to one who needs
    attention keeps his technique alive. When we train  an animal, it repeats
    behavior that it thinks will bring reward. If there is no  response to what
    it does, positive reinforcement is removed and the behavior  stops. In the
    same way, bland indifference takes the weapon from a critic’s  hand.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes the attack is too  much to ignore. In families of narcissists
    where criticism is favored, there  are unspoken tenets of behavior, like:
    “He who wields the knife is powerful. If  I tell you what to do, I know
    more. Smarter is better” and “I raise myself by  putting you down.” I was
    raised under such an onslaught and was too often hurt  to shrug it off.
    Children of narcissists can develop emotional soft spots from  parental
    pounding. We are like tenderized veal. Criticism keeps hitting home  because
    we believe what is said. Children of narcissists have been pounded into
    belief. Our parents know our sore points because they originally created
    them.
</p>
<p>
    If what is said is  objectionable, goes too far, or is said too often, we
    may need a more active  approach to eliminate this critical behavior. Humor
    is one of the most  effective and harmless ways of teaching. Humor does not
    have to be of the  ho-ho-ho kind. It can be an event that stops the attacker
    cold, like showing by  gentle comment and question that he is ill-informed
    about something you know  quite well.
</p>
<p>
    Take your parent’s insistence  on publicly criticizing you. You feel
    humiliated and unable to stop her, which  may call for “heroic” tactics.
    This can be humor of the outrageous kind that  takes courage to effect. One
    who succumbs to his parent’s tongue does better if  the humorous scene is
    rehearsed. You are going to make it impossible for the  parent to continue
    without self-humiliation. She will see you as a person not  to mess with,
    one who can interfere with her manipulations and tricks.
</p>
<p>
    A father plagued his  thirty-five-year old daughter for not marrying.
    <a name="page230"></a>He  disapproved of her lifestyle, which he thought
    reflected badly on him. He had  just married a social climber whose sons
    were engaged to “model” females with  page-boy hairdos, polished nails,
    up-to-the-minute clothing. They had the look  that was “in” at the time for
    upwardly mobile yuppies. This made him insecure,  ashamed, and determined to
    reform her by rubbing her nose in her “embarrassing”  condition. His way of
    life was devoted to reforming people. He began discussing  her unmarried
    state while driving a car full of people, including his wife and  two
    stepsons, on an elevated driveway near the water.
</p>
<p>
    His daughter was waiting. He  raised the topic like a sledge hammer,
    pounding nails into the plank of her  being. She had asked her analyst how
    to get out of victimization, being  grilled, embarrassed, and wrong. He told
    her to do what she would never have  dared without his advice. It was a
    piece of theater that used her parent’s  values. Her shrink was a respected
    man who had helped her before. His script  would offer her father a lesson.
</p>
<p>
    Her father was launched on  her marital condition. Why was she not married
    and at her age? What of her  loneliness, etc.? He regarded his point of view
    as the one and only way to be.  Her stepbrothers looked at her reaction. She
    did not think it then, but they  too put up with plenty of criticism from
    him. She felt surrounded by  criticizing enemies, drew a deep breath, and
    pictured the vulnerable position  she would soon be in. In her mind, her
    shrink said, “Do it,” and she did.
</p>
<p>
    “Dad, there’s something I’ve  been meaning to tell you for a long time.”
    “What?” he said, with mounting  sadism in his tone. “I’m gay and I shall not
    marry.” Her father didn’t know the  truth, but was thrown by her lack of
    propriety. The car swerved a little. She  had been heard by the class of
    people he wanted to impress. He would have  unabashedly pinned her for
    living alone but gay was something else. Gay lost  him points with his
    audience and a narcissist is always trying to score on  image.
</p>
<p>
    He snorted and swerved the  car, too anxious to ask more. “You can’t be,” he
    sputtered into his collar, to  which she said nothing. He dared not pursue
    it. I am not using this story to  demean homosexuality. It is only an
    example of how to use an atypical point of  view or one of the parent’s weak
    spots to lay the narcissistic attack to rest.  Her tone
    <a name="page231">
    </a>
    was friendly and then she was silent. It was his  decision whether to
    continue discussing marriage.
</p>
<p>
    The narcissist did not admit  that what she said hit home. That would entail
    a loss of face. Deep inside,  what she said pertained to him. It is
    difficult for a narcissist to give a sign  of change. If you are looking for
    change writ large, you should go to someone  else. A small but significant
    change not directly stated was that he did not  again discuss her unmarried
    life in front of other people. Perhaps, as was said  to me, this was a big
    victory after all.
</p>
<p>
    Narcissism is a tale of  codependency. The codependent person cares for the
    person who abuses some kind  of drug. The codependent has her arms wrapped
    round a person who has his arms  wrapped round his drug, be it alcohol,
    cocaine, fame, power over people, money,  etc. If the abuser is
    narcissistic, his arms are wrapped around his image. From  his defensive
    isolation, the narcissist demands that his codependent child get  vicarious
    satisfaction from the parent’s pleasure in self. The child hears what  is
    wrong with herself or about her and her parent’s “greatness.” Otherwise the
    child is ignored and must be happy that her parent can have an admirable and
    independent image. In the parent’s philosophy, his child cannot say no.
</p>
<p>
    Insensitivity was shown by a  narcissistic father who, despite his ex-wife’s
    death two weeks before, sent his  daughter a Xerox copy of the letter he had
    mailed to the local newspaper  without its being published. It concerned our
    nation’s unnecessary expenditure  on items of war to shield us from “Red”
    enemies while vital services in the  country fell apart. Disappointed by the
    newspaper’s lack of response, he asked  her for a reaction. Not a word was
    said about the loss of her mother. She did  not answer his letter, for which
    he undoubtedly blamed her.
</p>
<p>
    Children of narcissists are  confused about what is fair to self and parent.
    They need to develop such  judgment, but how are they to do it? It helps to
    talk to friends and to observe  relations between nonnarcissistic people.
    Psychotherapy may be necessary to get  the stuck engine of self turning. A
    grownup’s desire to lean too heavily on his  child, while pitiful, is not
    fair. The narcissistic parent is needy, which  makes his child feel guilty
    for withholding. But the child should not surrender  to pressure that he go
    beyond his means and reason.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page232"></a>I  remember wondering who and what should be the
    recipient of my care. My analyst  set me to thinking about it with a mythic
    tale. He spoke this way because he  knew that I would overlook the truth of
    direct comment. Children of narcissists  are trained to ignore reality and
    to stick to their parents’ rationalizations.  The analyst wanted to
    circumvent this by entering my spirit through imagination  and the
    unexpected. His tale was tough to swallow. It lingered in my mind for
    months and years. It is with me now.
</p>
<p>
    A mother bird was able to fly  only one of her four babies at a time across
    the ocean. She put a fledgling on  her wing and said, “When I am old, will
    you fly across the water with me on  your wing?” “Oh yes, Mother,” said the
    birdie out of love. Mother took this  baby out over the ocean and dropped it
    in. She went back for her second and  asked the same question. “Mother, I
    love you so much that I will save you  then.” The second birdie followed the
    first into the drink. Mother dropped the  third one to drown for the very
    same response and approached her fourth. Asked  what this birdie would one
    day do when it was grown and she was old, it  answered, “Oh Mother, forgive
    me. I love you so much but when I am your age I shall  have my own young to
    carry across the sea.”
</p>
<p>
    This baby was carried to the  farther shore. It is natural to support first
    ourselves and then our young. It  is not our wish to turn our parents down.
    We want them always with us but  should not sacrifice ourselves and the next
    generation to save our parents’  lives. It is our obligation to look ahead.
</p>
<p>
    This biological perspective  contradicts the narcissist’s demand for primary
    position with everyone. He  stars in a psychic play with only one character,
    who is looking in the mirror.  His child does not have the time or energy to
    supply what the parent’s  deficient system needs. The child’s energy must go
    to his or her own future,  which includes the lives of his children. Like
    all grownups, the parent must  fix himself. Narcissism is a sickness and a
    weakness. You, his child, can be  angry at the lack of love received from
    him and can bypass rage to feel  compassion and regret. But his problems
    require expert help.
</p>
<p>
    We get along better with the  narcissistic parent if we stop living by his
    opinions and his rules. As a  child, I backed down from what I thought
    important, to please him and avoid  attack. I did not want to be
    <a name="page233"></a>associated with something he  thought wrong and
    undermined myself to win approval. For example, my father kept  saying that
    the math I couldn’t understand was easy. It made the matter worse  that
    every lesson with him was filled with pejorative comments.
</p>
<p>
    Rather than investigate my  difficulty with numbers, my trouble with one and
    two, I was told, “You are  stupid,” and “Math is easy.” Accordingly, I acted
    stupid and got the lowest  marks in the class. How stupid I must be if it
    really was so easy. I remember  receiving a 15 on one test. I always thought
    that I would fail but sometimes  concentration surged forward out of fear
    and my work improved dramatically. It  was strange to get a near-to-top
    grade on a test like the New York State  Regents exams, which kept me from
    failing in class. Afterward, I would sink  back into obscurity with a
    teacher who would scratch her head and wonder who I  copied from. According
    to my narcissistic parent, except for math I did well in  school because I
    somehow faked intelligence and bought my teachers off.  Actually, I loved to
    read. Aside from this I backed down and kowtowed to him in  the deepest way,
    acting out what he thought of me.
</p>
<p>
    Seeing him as correct, I was  dragged into the lowest of moods by his
    assessment, which considered my  problems disastrous, inevitable, to be
    cured only if I followed his advice.  Years went by and his negative
    pressure started to get me mad. But anger is not  a final step. It shows
    that my expectations of him were unrealistic. A  narcissistic father phoned
    his child to say that he read one of her newspaper  articles and it was not
    good enough. At the same time, he said that she  underestimated the
    magnificence of his contributions to the world and to her.  Such comments
    were familiar intellectual pap for her to eat. When they stopped  talking on
    the phone, she exploded into well-chosen epithets.
</p>
<p>
    Her response showed a combination  of strength and weakness. It was a
    strength that she didn’t feel too  constricted to admit her anger and didn’t
    need to try and back him down. It was  a weakness that she expected
    something different from the critical/superior  message she always got from
    him. She thought about how to handle future  situations in which he would
    want to evaluate her work, since his comments  undermined her. She lacked
    sufficient perspective to disregard them.
</p>
<p>
    Her analyst suggested that  she let him read her work but ask him to make
    comments only on paper. She was  to tell him that she would
    <a name="page234"></a>not attend to any criticism of  her work that was
    verbally communicated. When his notes would appear, she  privately knew that
    she could file them in the garbage. Of course she would  have to enforce her
    rule with him, and narcissistic parents will often try to  slip one in. They
    are power-hungry and self-righteous about their “giving” you  what you
    “need”—the image of superior judgment that makes them speak. Also it  is
    hard for a child not to read a parent’s notes since she is always waiting
    and looking for his positive response. She has not yet decided to deprive
    him  of reading her work but does know that telling him to stop criticizing
    her will  not meet with success. He has already been told this innumerable
    times by many  people.
</p>
<p>
    What do we do with our anger  toward them? Anger has a healthy side if it
    puts us on the road to change.  Tillie was raised to smile and conceal her
    anger. Negative emotions were  treated as undesirable by a mother who ruled
    and was obeyed by everyone. After  years of analysis, Tillie feels good
    about expressing mild anger at her  mother’s provocation. Such expression
    makes her feel free and she enjoys its  heat. Anger expressed is better than
    being a Goody Two-Shoes.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes, though, we hate  ourselves for getting mad. We think that we
    should be beyond such response.  Nick was angered by his parent’s
    self-centered drive and attacked himself for  feeling angry. This demand
    showed he has narcissistic values that can’t accept  his imperfections.
</p>
<p>
    Unrealistic expectations and  consequent disappointments keep us unhappy
    with our parents. If we understand  that parental egocentricity is based on
    feelings of inferiority, narcissistic  outpourings can be heard as notes
    upon the wind. If our narcissistic parent  repeatedly disappoints us by
    claiming to possess more value than he has, anger  comes until we
    understand. A therapist spoke with humor of their posture when  he said,
    “How reassuring it is to know that in our changing world, the narcissist
    remains the same.”
</p>
<p>
    Review your understanding of  narcissism until it automatically appears in
    response to your parent’s  controlling words and gestures. Once you can
    disregard such behavior, you may  get in touch with your feelings of
    affection. Where does this love come from?  In early childhood your parent
    felt some love for you. You walked and talked  together. He tickled you and
    shared the butterflies interposed with <a name="page235"></a>criticism and
    intermittent unavailability. Little things mean  a lot. From such moments
    grew love that lives on despite the clamoring of your  anger and your need.
</p>
<p>
    As you grow more realistic  and see your parent’s blocks to loving, look for
    fuller loving from a  nonnarcissistic person. Raised with the narcissistic
    version of love, it can be  a lengthy process before you know the kind of
    love you need. It is difficult  for many children of narcissists to expand
    their definition of love to meet  their deficit.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps you have changed and  want to get together with your parent. The
    issue of your change comes up. In  the past, you always did what he wanted
    but now your own interests are  precious. You do not want to return to your
    formerly empty state by subscribing  to the parent’s call for replication as
    if you lacked identity of your own.
</p>
<p>
    You want to spend time  together doing something pleasing to both of you.
    Since you once shared an  early life, it is unlikely that you have no
    interests in common. State what you  would like to do and hear her response.
    If what interests you is unacceptable  to her and what she suggests does not
    appeal to you, try a second idea and a  third. Keep proposing until you find
    something that appeals to you both.  Compromise means finding what suits you
    although it may not be on the top of  either list. If she likes history and
    you like museums, go to a museum that  shows historic events. Each loses and
    gains a bit.
</p>
<p>
    Giving in is different from  compromise. Giving in has the spirit of
    surrender in which you please the other  by disregarding your self. The
    narcissistic person stages a scene of temper or  grief. Feeling frightened,
    guilty, or oppressed, you give the squalling person  what she wants. You
    give, but do not want to do so, in order to get the relief  of her calming
    down. Such pacification is not compromise since the profits go a  single
    way. Trying to create a bargaining table with the narcissist can lead to
    strife since listening to you as if your needs counted is new for her.
    Fighting  takes two people. In your new way of being, a self can be firm
    without a fight.
</p>
<p>
    The child of a narcissist who  is used to pacifying his parent feels the
    hopeless longing that addicts and  codependents label love. Addiction is a
    longing that is never satisfied.  Becoming real by self-expression brings
    the possibility of receiving a  different kind of love. You will be loved
    for who you really are. The  narcissist hopes that others subscribe
    <a name="page236"></a>to her view even in  their silence. Hearing your
    viewpoint and giving it weight makes her feel  demolished. This is the
    narcissistic illness and why she must be lonely.  Arriving at a mutual
    decision will not be easy for her. She must learn that  sharing the power of
    decision will not objectively vanquish either one of you.
</p>
<p>
    Once you arrive at a mutually  acceptable choice of activity and are on your
    way, there will be less pain, although  the narcissist will still feel some.
    Her own parent disregarded her real self,  which is why she allows no one to
    get close. Now you, the child whose love she  needs, introduce the necessity
    of there being two people and viewpoints again.  She fears to be discarded
    but you cannot fully solve her problem since it needs  psychoanalysis. Your
    goal must be limited to finding an activity that is  pleasurable for you
    both. If none is found today, look for one another time.
</p>
<p>
    In getting together, it is  good to know the limits of your relating. If you
    want to improve how you get  along, do not underestimate its difficulty.
    Rather than revert to a submissive  state, and knowing how hard it is to
    change, be progressive in your demands. Go  from easy to hard. What are the
    expected problems? Each family is different. In  my tribe there are
    compulsive talkers, know-it-alls who parade knowledge and  leave no room for
    you to speak. You are supposed to fade away and look  interested. If you
    enter their monologues and disagree with them, their speech  will cut you
    down.
</p>
<p>
    If your parent is a talker,  establish ground rules that stop interruption.
    He is not to interrupt you and  you are not to interrupt him. Interrupting
    is a psychological way of killing  the speaker. When you are interrupted,
    let him speak until finished and then  pick up exactly where you left off
    until your thought is completed. Eliminate  interruption until you both can
    converse in relative freedom.
</p>
<p>
    If he wants you to share an  activity that only he enjoys, and a narcissist
    commonly believes his choice to  be the best and only desirable one, the
    child part in you will want to win his  praise by acceding. You cannot
    regularly do this and be thought of as an  autonomous person. Instead you
    need to gently indicate disinterest in the  activity and to underreact to
    hurt feelings he expresses in response. Sympathy  for his feelings is not
    surrender. Explain what you would like to do and keep  looking for what you
    can share.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page237"></a>The child  of a narcissist can fool himself into
    expecting a different parent and then be  driven to distraction by what
    occurs. Do not fall into such fantasy. If what he  wants to do or discusses
    is of little interest to you, change the topic to what  interests you both.
    Such change is not as destructive as phony talk in which  you secretly die
    of boredom. If the narcissist is a compulsive talker and you  do not like
    such verbiage, avoid a meeting that allows for endless talking. You  do not
    want to battle against his need for an ear.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t be shocked by continued  narcissistic arrogance. Appreciate what you
    can but don’t lie. It is possible  to point to his strengths without
    treating the narcissist as a god. If he puts  you down, jokingly put
    yourself lower. I don’t always put myself down, but  sometimes doing it
    exposes the competition behind the criticism and thereby  disempowers the
    parent. Don’t complain about his acting powerful. My analyst  gave the
    example of trying to make yourself bigger by getting on another’s back  in a
    deep swimming pool. The person beneath goes down but the person on top is
    no higher.
</p>
<p>
    Limit your time together to  how much you enjoy. Set time for
    nonconversational activities, a play or  concert, a walk in the woods. Your
    parent may also need to remove herself from  your talk and demands. Do not
    overrun established boundaries. She has not often  respected your
    personhood. It will be hard for you to state your limits and for  her to
    follow. If your needs clash and your boundaries are overrun, go with the
    limit of the person who can take less. It is like Jewish law about a window.
    If  the one who needs it closed is weaker than the one who wants it open,
    the  window is closed. You do not want to injure the weaker person. Defer to
    the one  who suffers. It is easier to meet again than to generate
    frustration, and it  takes a lot of knowledge and discipline to keep it
    kind.
</p>
<p>
    How much time together is  pleasurable? This can change with time and become
    less or more. You learn by  observation. What do you do about the lack of
    positive response? Many say that  we should not expect a damned thing from
    the narcissist, but this is not  possible or necessary for one who is her
    child. There is love for both of you.  You learn to love by separating the
    wheat from the chaff. Love appreciated  means not asking for the kind of
    love that the parent cannot give. And vice  versa.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page238"></a>You will  have a kinder relationship if you do not
    have to defer to and buy into each  other’s images. This gives you the
    freedom to develop compassion. Set it up so  that what you do together
    offers opportunity to feel. You may be surprised at  how little love there
    is. Or how much. The more you support her faltering self,  the more you will
    know the love she brings. I know a parent who led a  self-centered life. In
    his eighty-fourth year, he told his daughter, “You are  the center of my
    life,” and it was true. By seeing the parent’s limitations and  fears, we
    can allow ourselves to feel the love we have for him.

<p>
    How do you confront the negative inner parent when it attacks you? How  do
    you get rid of it, refute its hateful message, and make its influence less
    destructive?
</p>
<p>
    It is as hard to end this  book as it is to acquire self-appreciation.
    Children of narcissists need to  learn to discriminate, not to absorb every
    negative opinion and directive that  comes our way. Once we were too open.
    Then we reacted by moving toward total  closure in defense. Closure leads to
    boredom and deadness. We need to find a  middle ground where things can
    enter consciousness and be subject to evaluation  before they are accepted
    as a part of our being. We need not absorb what we  don’t find valid.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page241"></a>It is  difficult for us to find the middle ground. We
    were raised in extremes and do  not know the middle. When life is easy, the
    middle is easier to establish. When  life is difficult we need to work to
    find it. It is the struggle toward this  objective with which I end this
    book.
</p>
<p>
    The negative introject is  partly the voice of your attacking and
    restrictive narcissistic parent whose  thinking took up residence in your
    mind. It is not rightly a part of your self  but a hostile foreigner that
    watches you with a critical eye. Little escapes  its quest for control. It
    criticizes you with such comments as “You’re a  failure” and “Why try?” Your
    feelings of depression strengthen its force. It  makes you discard
    appreciation and distrust affection. Its punitive demands and  paralyzing
    arguments stop you from trying to change.
</p>
<p>
    We want to please this  uninvited judge that sounds so much like our
    narcissistic parents. We succumb  to its messages, the thoughts that we hate
    and almost believe. We want to  reject such miserable input but lack the
    foggiest notion of how to do so. We  resentfully accept its presence as a
    fact of life.
</p>
<p>
    My negative introject entered  the scene a few hours after a phone call from
    my esteemed agent to tell me this  book was sold. Up I went in mood and
    spirit. Hours later I arrived home and my  feelings started shifting
    strangely. Soon I was depressed. It was as if the  depression had come from
    the sky but actually it came from the attitude of my  negative introject. I
    was anxious and despondent as I questioned my ability to  do the work. It
    was as if the person who wrote the first half of the book was a  million
    miles away.
</p>
<p>
    My negative introject said,  “You’ll never finish the writing and will be
    humiliated, marked as a failure, a  tragedy, a landmark of shame.” I felt
    pummeled by this. It seemed to make  sense. My hopeless mood was evidence of
    my worthlessness. With a note of  triumph, my introject said, “That is you.”
    Later, while brushing my teeth, despondency  drew me to memories of
    childhood. I felt asthmatic shortness of breath and  wheezing, something I
    had not suffered since that era at times when I was  emotionally abandoned,
    stressed, and pressured. Being unable to breathe was the  physical aspect of
    my emotional horror. It was amazing to have an attack on the  day I heard
    about selling my book about children of narcissists.
</p>
<p>
    The negative introject  squashed my feelings of success and raised
    <a name="page242"></a>fears of  humiliation. Achieving and then losing again
    can be more painful than not  achieving at all, which is why many children
    of narcissists do so little.  Barely functioning defends us from loss. We
    were taught to feel responsible for  fate rather than to do what we can and
    let results fall as they may.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t be discouraged by this  tale. It was not a total loss but showed the
    response of my introject to  achievement that took me above my expected
    level. At that time and totally  discouraged, I could not laugh. After a
    period of emotional hassle, I  laughingly resisted the introject’s attack on
    my commitment and returned to  work. When we measure the achievement of a
    person, we need to know her past,  the place from where she has come.
</p>
<p>
    I heard my introject’s call  to failure. It said that I would not be paid
    for my work, which part of me  believed while the rest of me pushed on. I
    heard my healthy side saying, “The  gods can have their way after you have
    finished.” I am happy to have written  this. It represents the triumph of my
    self.
</p>
<p>
    A house divided, children of  narcissists must struggle to exist. They fight
    with their negative introjects  and feel trounced on and wearied by its
    endless attempts to suppress their  efforts. They receive its directives as
    punishment or correction and are led  into hopelessness. If undermined, they
    accept messages that read like poison.  The power they give to their
    introject makes it hard to eradicate.
</p>
<p>
    I increasingly identified  with my goals. A measure of health is the state
    of your self. Self and health  are one. Strength came from sharing insights
    with other children of  narcissists. Working on the book directly involved
    loyalty to my self. Could I  do it justice when continually undercut by my
    negative introject and by  narcissistic outsiders who focused on potential
    negative reactions? My worried  self still drove me to think, feel, and
    write. Never had my personality and  self been so close. My operations and
    feelings were as one. Wonderful to feel  myself being.
</p>
<p>
    In repeatedly silencing my  introject I learned more about the struggle.
    Eradication takes deliberate  thought and effort. You need to identify the
    introject as foreign to your self.  As long as we think of it as ours, we
    are at a disadvantage. If we see it as a  non-self, an identification that
    drives us to unacceptable roles, feelings, and  behaviors, we
    <a name="page243"></a>can work on it. Labeling it as non-self is  difficult
    because we unconsciously see the introject as an aspect of our  narcissistic
    parent. What do we do when loyalty to the parent opposes loyalty  to
    ourselves? We have been trained never to put self first. The narcissistic
    parent would call us selfish.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes we think the  introject a part of us and sometimes not. The
    introject feels strong, then  weak, then strong again. Outside circumstances
    affect it, as does therapeutic  examination. Group membership and individual
    therapy help. Logic attenuates its  form and negative circumstances bring it
    back. The battle can last a lifetime.  But it needn’t.
</p>
<p>
    This attacking and foreign  agent first enters our realm when we are babies
    and need our parents’ love. If  they are critical and narcissistic, their
    disapproving eye and angry mouth  start hurting us from within. As we grow,
    the negative introject imposes states  of limitation with which our self
    disagrees but is trounced by it and  imprisoned. The introject wants to be
    top dog and, unlike a conscience that  leads to reasonable comfort, it
    removes security from the self. Despite its  negative effect, a childish
    idea that this can lead to love glues us together.  Parent love was slow in
    coming but we knew no other way to get it.
</p>
<p>
    An adult is sickened by his  introject and thinks it harmful. He wants to
    set himself free but finds it hard  to do. He may be unaware that his child
    portion clings to childish ways and  ignores the consequences of such
    attitudes. Childish expectation can be hidden  in the unconscious and only
    detected by inference, for example in the content  of our dreams.
</p>
<p>
    You are bemused and anxious  about what you do. An extra portion of cake,
    the important job undone, choosing  an unloving lover. People dominated by
    negative introjects blame it on the  stars. They treat their introject’s
    pressure as a joke and ask, “Why am I doing  this?” They follow its
    instructions to fail, surrender responsibility, and  admit that their child
    self is in charge. “You know me when I …” They speak as  if they are
    inhabited by an external control. They suffer from repetition but  do not
    mark their behavior as addictive, which would obligate them to try to
    change. Since their problem is addictive, they indulge in childhood needs
    and  pleasures while their adult lives fall apart. They say “somehow” and
    “maybe” of  their intentions while staving off adult needs,
    responsibilities, and  expectations.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page244"></a>They  indulge in childish behavior stemming from the
    unstated wish that this will  cause the narcissistic parent to love them.
    All people have childish wishes. To  realize our potential, however, we must
    stand alone and face the fact that the  narcissistic parent cannot now
    adequately meet our childhood needs any more  than he or she could when we
    were growing up. If we stick to childish behavior,  we will continue to
    inhabit a dreamland of wishes and illusory expectations,  addicted to the
    unrealizable desire for the narcissistic parent to meet our  needs.
</p>
<p>
    The introject uses our  parent’s values. If he or she is narcissistic, such
    values cannot lead the  child to happiness. We do not know that we were
    propagandized into many of our  beliefs, which makes them hard for us to
    know and surrender. It takes more than  introspection to see them. We need
    the input of friends, therapist, therapy  group, people who share similar
    battles but who are not bound by identical  constraints. These others are
    also puzzled by the working of their unconscious.  All work at depleting the
    negative introject’s power.
</p>
<p>
    Therapy groups are usually  not exclusively formed for children of
    narcissistic parents. But most groups  help in multiple ways. In group, you
    find out that you are not the only one  with a hideous self-image that was
    put in place by endless parental demands for  change. The narcissistic
    habits that you manifest will be responded to as  objectionable in no
    uncertain terms. Group therapy bypasses the social  inhibition against
    expressing displeasure. Some group members would flare up at  me when I took
    an all-knowing and commanding position toward their behavior.  Inwardly
    insecure, I had no idea that I sounded like my parent in speaking as I  did.
</p>
<p>
    Then there were friends. One  was Hal, a Viennese gentleman who also
    attended graduate school in psychology.  He was a lover who reminded me of
    my physical beauty. Of my small breasts he  would say, “More than a mouthful
    is wasted.” He helped me with my fear of  statistics and when his
    ministrations were over, this child of a narcissistic  got the higher grade.
</p>
<p>
    He had an outrageous sense of  humor that appeared in a series of
    photographs he took of me in my despair. In  one photo, we were on vacation
    in Provincetown and I was lying on a rock jetty,  pummeled into hopelessness
    by my introject. He lovingly called it, “Golomb  gives up.”
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page245"></a>He would  cry with me from sadness—his, mine, and ours
    together. His had to do with being  a refugee from Nazi Germany and losing
    his family, especially his beloved  cousin who had set out for Israel never
    to be seen again. At times Hal would  act like a robot, a mechanical
    creature that walked with a jerk and  increasingly lost control, which
    thrilled and scared me as it woodenly followed  me around mumbling
    inanities. He was acting the role of a person who had  completely lost his
    ability to feel, a common defense for people who have gone  through the
    horrors of war. In actual fact, he had many feelings, some so  strong they
    scared him.
</p>
<p>
    Together we adopted Effie, a  dog that became my friend for life. Effie was
    the name taken from my own and  given to the doll I most loved. By six or
    so, I had washed the doll, which  stilled its voice, but I loved it just as
    much. My parents intended to buy me a  “better” one. No one asked me if I
    wanted to hold on to Effie, that extension  of my self. One day I came home
    from school to find that Effie was gone. A new  doll with Toni hair did not
    still my grief. It was one of the many moves they  performed which said you
    have nothing and no place to call your own.
</p>
<p>
    Hal helped return to me the  spirit of what I had once loved and missed. He
    took joy in the dog’s personality.  We both had so much fun living without
    having to prove or be something  different. He shielded me from my parent’s
    narcissistic opinion. When things  appeared dire, he never gave up hope. For
    the first time, I was with a man by  whom I felt accepted.
</p>
<p>
    Do negative thoughts lurk at  the back of your mind like uninvited guests?
    Such ideas can be so habitual that  you do not think them strange. In
    freeing yourself, it helps to be funny. “You  here again?” Humor cuts the
    power of oppressive ideas. Laughing, you can see  that you don’t believe in
    everything you think. It is good to tell your  self-demolishing messages to
    those who have similar problems or who can enjoy a  good joke.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes you listen too long  before acting. The introject gets hold of
    your mood and outwits your common  sense and humor. If you can’t politely
    back off, continue on your way despite  inner criticism. Reason and will can
    keep you going till you get support.
</p>
<p>
    A time of need can open you  to the negative introject. My negative
    <a name="page246"></a>introject had been  quiet for a while when a
    catastrophe brought it back. At age forty-seven, I had  gone for a bike ride
    that led to an accident in which I injured my head. Local  hospital X rays
    showed two concussions and a small fracture of the skull. This  hospital
    would not treat head injuries and told my parents to send me to  another
    hospital. Instead of my parents explaining to me what was happening, I
    found myself strapped to a stretcher and against my will was carried away in
    an  ambulance. I was terrified, resistant, and they knew it. I have a long
    history  in natural healing and wanted to see my Chinese herbal physician.
    But my  parents were too scared by the doctor’s story to tell me what was
    happening and  acted in a typically narcissistic way.
</p>
<p>
    In fear and over my protest,  I was taken to the second hospital, where I
    received the medication I did not  want. The right to make decisions was
    taken from me and given to my parents.  They allowed the doctors full
    control of treatment and ignored my endless  requests to be removed because
    the doctors had implanted fear of my demise.
</p>
<p>
    I would have done it  otherwise but had lost control over my medical
    treatment. I call it “medical”  but in fact the only medicine I received was
    tranquilizers. I wanted to leave  but was literally tied down and drugged. I
    was always kept tied, since the  hospital knew I intended to leave. I was
    tied neck, wrists, midriff, and  ankles, except for the few hours that my
    mother visited and would untie me  against hospital disapproval. She never
    could believe that I was otherwise kept  tied and chose to think it occurred
    five minutes before she arrived. However,  my unhappiness, anxiety,
    displeasure, and sickness were slowly sinking into her  awareness.
</p>
<p>
    The hospital concealed the  fact that I was continuously injected into a
    state of confusion and stupor with  a tranquilizer used for psychotics who
    are difficult to control. My relatives  were told that I was on no
    medication, although from it I suffered depression,  anxiety, confusion. My
    speech was slightly stilted from the head injury but  mainly from drugging.
    These and my constant demand for departure were used as  evidence by the
    staff that I needed to stay a minimum of six months. Such  treatment was not
    for the concussion for which they had nothing but to make me  renounce and
    forget my intention to leave. They persuaded my narcissistic  father and his
    narcissistic family, who held conference in the corner of my  room without
    any input from me.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page247"></a>I was  desperate to leave and becoming sicker by the
    day. I constantly demanded, begged,  and pleaded with my relatives for
    release to my treatment of choice, but no one  would listen, which was a
    paradigm of the usual situation for the child of  narcissistic parents.
    Sickened and helpless as I was, it could not have been  more horrible.
</p>
<p>
    My mother would feel terrible  and say, “You’ll leave tomorrow.” But lying
    was her way and she was too scared  to follow through. That I expected to
    leave was put on my hospital record as a  sign of my living in delusion.
</p>
<p>
    I became my child self in  search of a loving parent. I wanted a hand to
    reach for mine with no strings  attached. I needed understanding and support
    for what I judged important. This  a narcissist cannot give. Denial of my
    need set my negative introject in  motion.
</p>
<p>
    I was not without ideas of my  own, a little unintelligible due to the
    drugging, but desperately trying to  communicate. I never had imagined that
    I, a well-trained clinical psychologist  with twenty years of experience in
    mental health care, would not be listened  to. It was too frightening to
    contemplate. On the edge of consciousness, I  toyed with the idea that the
    hospital was killing me with nontreatment and  drugging. I gave up on
    receiving help and was sinking into thoughts of suicide  and murder. I fell
    into the severe anxiety and hopelessness of a stress  disorder that lasted
    well after I left the hospital. It had everything to do  with the care I
    received and little with my response to concussion.
</p>
<p>
    Narcissistic torture feeds  the introject. To visitors who would not heed
    me, I was an “it.” Not knowing  that I was drugged, they ignored my requests
    as fantasy. My narcissistic uncle  later told me that I begged him to get me
    out, up to the point of flirtation.  It was horribly sad to hear him speak.
    My mother untied me each day for our  four hours of visitation but would not
    let herself believe that I was tied down  all the rest of the time. Everyone
    avoided awareness of the painful facts of  what I tried to tell them. The
    doctors knew best. My mother, less narcissistic  than the others, saw that I
    was not getting better and heard my mounting  anxiety and depression. Each
    day she promised to remove me, then fell into fear  and paralysis.
</p>
<p>
    On my ninth and final day in  the hospital, she found me wrapped in
    restraints from neck to shins and arm to  arm. Before this event, I had
    managed to untie myself and had gone to the desk  to demand release.
    <a name="page248"></a>They refused and it turned into a fight  with eight in
    staff to pin me down. My horrified mother arrived and asked,  “What is this,
    an asylum? My daughter is here for concussion.” As always, I  begged to
    leave.
</p>
<p>
    She saw my fury, hating her  for what they did with her permission. It was
    too much for her. “She is  leaving.” Staff was up in arms. “She’ll be ruined
    on the outside, will fall on  her head, and take to bed forever.” I left
    AMA. (Against Medical Advice),  feeling how few people can understand your
    needs. Friends had been instructed  by the staff to dismiss my words as
    babble. They forgot me as a person because  I was trauma-short on
    vocabulary. Now that time has gone by and the facts have  come out, they are
    shaken.
</p>
<p>
    This tragedy was in keeping  with the predictive voice of my negative
    introject—a split skull and a major  battle against the forces of
    institutionalization before I could get on with  healing myself through
    natural methods and the writing of this book. My  struggle echoed the
    introject’s words: “You will be killed for trying.”
</p>
<p>
    I don’t bob as much for my  narcissistic parent’s praise. Before, desire
    kept me wide-eyed in hope of  approval. Now I do not trust his word and
    intention. One does not care so much  to win the flattering words of people
    you do not think are on your side. What  is that praise worth and who is the
    one they are praising? When I am falsely  flattered like this, I no longer
    feel like the original me. I am looking on.
</p>
<p>
    I had forgotten my passivity  as a child of narcissistic parents but this
    accident brought it back. My  concussion caused dependency that was used by
    my narcissistic parent to attack  and push me further down. He considered a
    “healing” institution when I was  asking for release. The narcissist always
    knows what is best for you no matter  what you say. Now I look before I
    react and events are not coming at me so  expectedly. I am better able to
    judge what is going on in other people.
</p>
<p>
    I feel the subtle sensation  of change. I do not feel and think the same
    way. When conducting a therapy  session, I have visual imagery of patients
    that they later confirm, which shows  that I am picking up even minimal
    cues. I am more aware of lying, that people  say what they think you want to
    hear but which they don’t intend; that some  people are reliable and others
    are not. I am more sensitive to subtleties.  Sometimes I ask myself if I am
    growing paranoid, but from the amount of love I  feel, I would say that I am
    growing up.
</p>
<p>
    Without personal analysis,  children of narcissists suffer worse
    consequences. <a name="page249"></a>Using  the writing of this book as a
    metaphor for any plan you choose, it is a  struggle to carry it out. If
    completed, your book will not leave the drawer. If  a publisher is found,
    will you perish in a hospital? It is interesting that the  biking accident
    happened to me on the day following the sale of my book.
</p>
<p>
    The introject is ruthless. At  varying times, you will have to battle its
    self-suppressive force. The  introject will activate to knock you back and
    down. Your assigned position is  what the narcissistic parent wants.
</p>
<p>
    Being in a crisis with  greater expectations makes you more accessible to
    your negative introject. If  you have narcissistic parents, relatives, and
    friends, your hopes are often  disappointed. You rarely get what you ask for
    even on your birthday. What is it  like when your needs are stated and the
    parents still go their own way? A  parent teaches her child to blame himself
    for parental shortcomings and later  for all bad events. In a crisis, you
    will see yourself as at fault. The  negative introject is fed with anti-self
    material and gives you messages of  self-hatred in return.
</p>
<p>
    Even in an extreme situation,  it is wrong to think the narcissist will be
    ready to meet your everyday hopes  and needs, much less extreme ones. Do not
    attack yourself for wanting this. You  are a pupil of self-punishment. Your
    introject will turn against you when there  is insufficient consideration
    and love. Needing nurturance from those who lack  it to give is no cause to
    attack yourself.
</p>
<p>
    Your introject babbles about  your lovelessness in explanation. This learned
    distortion can be undercut by  relating to a person or creature by whom you
    feel loved. On my post-accident  “vacation,” I was in love with a Vermont
    puppy, a huge black Labrador that  followed me around, even onto my couch,
    where it deposited its tiny 100 pounds  on my chest, nibbling wildly at my
    fingers and face. It was so full of  outrageous life that it made me laugh
    and got me going. It was so friendly and  assertive that I could not remain
    in a bleak mood.
</p>
<p>
    Find people who can love you  and vice versa. Bring them into your life. Are
    you affixed to narcissists? Do  you need to learn to recognize a different
    type of person who will support you  in happy times and emergency? If
    nurturance is available, the fingers of your  negative introject will not
    clutch at your throat.
</p>
<p>
    Although we may not be aware  of it, we spend our lives separating
    <a name="page250"></a>from our parents. When  we are in emotional need, our
    need for parent love becomes strong again. We  think the appearance of this
    need should make us unhappy since our narcissistic  mind is vain. It says
    that childish needs are eternally childish. But people are eternally
    childish and eternally growing. It is  resistance to the process that makes
    for problems. Maturing never ends. It is  immaturity that declares us
    finished. The narcissist arrests his pattern of  growth with a stance of
    perfection and does not mature. Denying parts of self  that need work means
    hiding in a limited state.
</p>
<p>
    Children of narcissists must  fight for independence from the narcissistic
    parents who would live through  them. Such parents treat their children as
    imperfect and rejected or perfect  and connected to the parent. Such a
    concatenation of self and value is not the  road to development.
    Narcissistic parents do not grant adulthood to their  offspring as people on
    their own. The parent cannot conceive of such a  relationship.
</p>
<p>
    We are always becoming  autonomous and separating from our negative
    introject. It fights to hold on and  we struggle to let it go. It is self
    versus introject and each thought system  claims to be the real you. There
    is a guilty conflict between love of self and  love of parent. Can we live
    untrammeled by our parents’ word as expressed through  the introject? We
    would not have introjects like these if our parents hadn’t  rejected our
    basic human parts out of their own irrational pressures. Holding  on to a
    negative view of self keeps the introject alive. We need to believe in  our
    intrinsic value and right to err if we want to be introject-free.
</p>
<p>
    Our narcissistic parents see  us as a rehabilitation project. We express
    negative introjects inherited from  their own rejecting parents. Such
    introjects kept them from humane  responsiveness to us, a nightmare passed
    from generation to generation. With  knowledge, we will try to stop the
    transfer. We will not carry on its decisions  even toward ourselves. It is a
    battle. For life.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to change your  thinking to feel less pain but run from the pain
    introduced by the negative  introject, your pain will increase. It is like a
    helpless child’s response to  an attacking parent. “I must get away from
    this. It is too horrible to bear.”  Pain grows in proportion to the
    magnitude of your fear.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page251"></a>Instead  note, “I am giving myself hurtful messages
    but I know my tendency to think the  worst and shall first assess the
    difficulty.” Objectivity reduces your  introject’s power. If you find a
    problem in your behavior, it is not equivalent  to the worth of your self. A
    narcissist confuses his behavior and self, which  renders him defensively
    incapable of seeing his difficulties.
</p>
<p>
    Your negative introject can  haunt you with tragic fantasies about yourself.
    To heal, say, “Tell me all and  let me see it in a clear light.” Fears grow
    in the shadows. Phobic people are  haunted by fear. The more they avoid what
    they fear, the worse the phobia.  Phobia spreads to new objects that are
    connected with the old. Contamination  spreads through flight. Avoidance is
    a poor response.
</p>
<p>
    Approach the thing you fear  and do it till your fear runs out. If what you
    fear is the punitive voice of  your negative introject, do not run away,
    argue, or cry over its attack.  Fearful adulation gives it power. You wept
    to arouse your parents’ pity. It is  the awe of insecurity that attested to
    their greatness. They were flattered by  their power over you.
</p>
<p>
    In our culture, women often  cry instead of showing anger. Tears announce
    their inferior position. The child  of a narcissist is in a similar
    position. He cannot be openly angry with his  parents and later defers to
    their representative in the negative introject. He  needs to stop groveling
    beneath his introject’s heel and sniveling at its  words. He needs to remove
    the negative introject from its pedestal.
</p>
<p>
    If instead you support the  introject by letting its pejorative comments hit
    home, you are trading  punishment for the hope of love. If you put off the
    quest for freedom, you  always will lack love. Back and forth you go but
    once you surrender your quest  for love from a narcissist, you will feel
    emptiness, which hurts and makes you  wonder why you live. This is a time to
    mourn for what you will never have. In  mourning you accept that the
    narcissistic parent will never give as much love  as you need. No more
    chance to win the love that was absent. After suffering  this loss, you will
    move on. A loss that is known eventually can be healed.
</p>
<p>
    Coming from a childhood of  frequent pain, minimal touching, and little
    understanding, you can barely  tolerate your feelings. You falter at the
    crossroads and return to the  destructive mouthings of your introject
    <a name="page252"></a>or choose a  narcissistic partner. Finally you prepare
    yourself for the pain of knowing what  you lack. This is like an empty dock
    at which you can tie a different boat. The  boat of a person who loves you.
</p>
<p>
    Children of narcissists are  raised with the belief that they have traits
    that make them special and  unlovable. The narcissist focuses on his child’s
    flaws as reason for his own  incapacity to give. The child later is hurt by
    her introject’s criticism  because she believes her parent’s words.
    Exaggerating her own flaws keeps her  in character.
</p>
<p>
    Nonnarcissistic people see a  different image. They love one another with
    flaws perceived like smoke rising  from a fire. The fire is what counts. A
    narcissist projects his unacceptable  and secret flaws into his child and
    feels a lack of love for one so ruined. His  child feels alarm and
    depression when things go wrong. Her flaws justify a  troubled life. She
    doesn’t know that she lives an image handed down.
</p>
<p>
    You need to develop a neutral  and inquisitive attitude. How can you be
    friendly with the negative introject  that attacks you? A bully is
    strengthened by his victim’s fear but is thrown by  neutrality. If you are
    attentive to your introject without undue anxiety, you  will achieve a
    degree of separation.
</p>
<p>
    Listen to negative thoughts  without automatically accepting them as true. A
    nondefensive approach is good  with the critical parent as well. Objectivity
    achieves more than fighting. If  you fight, you are dismissed as infantile.
    When your conduct is neutral, your  views are more likely to be reckoned
    with. Listen and decide what is true and  to what degree. You may need
    consultation. If you are new to self-evaluation  and readily demolished,
    bring the comment to another person or group whose  opinion you trust.
</p>
<p>
    Creativity can help you heal.  When I had the notion of examining my
    introject, I was feeling weak and fearful  of the undertaking. I was in a
    macrobiotic center in California for my summer  vacation. This was a
    Japanese-style dwelling surrounded by mountains. It was  built in a hot
    valley where every possible fruit and vegetable was raised. It  gave cooking
    classes and helped us analyze our physical weaknesses. We learned  how to
    change our way of living in order to feel better and walked on the damp
    grass of early morning to get our energy moving. It had many minor healing
    workshops, including yoga and meditation.
</p>
<p>
    At that time, I felt that I  didn’t need more negative thoughts than
    <a name="page253"></a>I already had. I  was in a personally discouraged mood
    when I went to a workshop on healing  imagery. After the guidance of a slow
    entry into inner calm, one envisioned  living in a favorite spot. For me, it
    was the wilderness.
</p>
<p>
    I hoped to find some strength  and was skeptical, while wondering in what
    form it would come. Into my mind  came a moose, a beautiful, large, and
    quiet creature, sticking its antlered  head into my primitive,
    next-to-nature abode. My place was blessed. The moose  stayed a while, just
    was there and then left. I felt inspired by its presence  and sought its
    meaning in words but none would come. It simply was, like the  self, the
    song of connection with the earth, a spirit without words. It was  love of,
    to, and by the self.
</p>
<p>
    What does this meditative  vision and practice mean? Children of narcissists
    distrust and devalue their  inner selves as if nothing of value could come
    from inside. This is wrong.  Listen to your intuitive part and look with awe
    at what it produces.  Outpourings can take any form or meaning. It is your
    own symbolism. Creativity  does not come out of a can or TV. Children are
    creative but grow up to be  average adults who are pulled away from
    creativity. They think themselves  without creativity but have learned their
    impoverishment. Narcissistic parents  undermine your creativity with, “Is it
    good enough?” Good enough for what?  People talk about my writing and
    painting. “But you’re creative.” We are all  creative in our way. Talent,
    imagery, strength from the unconscious is human.  Your vision is different
    from mine but it is there.
</p>
<p>
    By creativity I mean allowing  your wishes and visions to inspire you. If
    you are moved by what comes to your  mind, something will emerge to express
    your inner state. You may find the  solution to a problem, write a song or
    story, a poem that captures deep  meaning. You impulsively take a walk in
    the woods and feel its life around you.  Suddenly a recipe comes to your
    mind for the curious remains in the icebox. You  remember the pleasure of an
    ancient friendship, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    Some therapists have said  that creative people avoid knowing their neuroses
    by turning their problems  into art. But this can be quite untrue. A
    creative person hears his crying self  and can’t avoid what he thinks and
    feels. He may use creative powers for  healing and seek imaginary or real
    solutions. The narcissistic parent often  teaches her child that there is
    only perfection or failure. If you open  yourself to <a
    name="page254"></a>creativity, there is an infinity of visions.  Look at
    your dreams, the tales you love to hear or tell, and things you find
    beautiful. You will see a young self waiting to develop. We are always young
    and always old.
</p>
<p>
    Children of narcissists are  trained not to trust their unconscious.
    Everything they do must meet an  external standard. Despite these blinders,
    our inner lives wait to nourish us.  Creativity comes if we are open and
    receptive. There is more to our self than a  learned opinion.
</p>
<p>
    Narcissistic parents taught  us to overvalue what we received from them and
    to undervalue our self and its  byproducts. Good was to be like them and bad
    came from following our own ideas.  From their condemnatory reaction, we
    learned to be afraid of filling our  personal desires. We live in familiar
    hell and call new behaviors negative  before the results are in.
</p>
<p>
    You need to live according to  experience and differ according to insight as
    you go. Your values can be your  own and not compulsively tied to external
    measures, such as those of your  narcissistic parent, which might include
    money, fame, beauty, smartness, power.  We can stop leading lives to impress
    the narcissistic community.
</p>
<p>
    We give ourselves a lower  rating than others do. Like all people, we make
    mistakes. These do not merit  condemnations to wear upon our breasts but are
    to learn from. Humor and courage  make good partners. Seeing your
    difficulties and your tendency to exaggerate  blame, humor makes it easier
    to change.
</p>
<p>
    One time I was meditating in  a large group. It was dark and the woman in
    front of me was restless,  continually moving her body. Meditators are
    supposed to sit quietly. In my  highmindedness, I hated her for her noise
    and spent a lot of my attention  calling her selfish and a thousand other
    names. It was all hatred and  resentment at her ruining “my” meditation. She
    was to blame for my mood until  the lights went on and I took a look at my
    “enemy.” She was crippled and found  it hard to sit.
</p>
<p>
    Children of narcissists are  much hurt by narcissistic parents and become
    prone to thinking themselves  attacked. We believe people are out to harm
    us, an error that is hard to  eradicate since we are always adding new
    examples to our list. Such thinking is  eradicated when we see nonenemies in
    their stead. It was so hard for her to  sit. I was amazed and sorry about
    what I felt. I learned about my tendency to  misperceive
    <a name="page255">
    </a>
    actions as intended to hurt. I misread facts  based on limited information
    and my predilection for feeling mistreated. A  great teaching. As I try to
    stop personalizing events, my life is becoming  easier.
</p>
<p>
    How are we to get over this  tendency, called personalizing? A meditation
    teacher once told a story about  this very problem. An Oriental man was
    rowing on a foggy lake. Unexpectedly,  his boat was crashed into by another.
    He cursed that careless rower and was  beside himself with anger at the
    other’s intolerable nerve. Then the boat that  hit his floated by and he
    found it empty. Bent on seeing himself beset, he had  created the plot of
    deliberation that gave him pain.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to get rid of the  personalizing tendency to think that people
    are against you, start with your  experience of growing up with narcissistic
    parents. Your life with them has  shaped your vision. They were destructive
    in their need to see things their  way. Was their aggressive and invasive
    ignorance meant to harm you or merely a  mirror view of their own inner
    world? I think the latter, since there was  nothing and no one outside their
    selves. There was no intention to do you harm  as they tried to fulfill
    their wishes and responsibilities. You were felt to be  an extension of
    them, with your own needs barely heeded. They were drowning people  clinging
    to a spar of wood. So desperate was their situation that they could  not see
    your position. If you broke through their protective reverie it  triggered a
    horrible mood.
</p>
<p>
    Then they would become intent  on giving injury or being mean. Their child
    was fighting their influence and  trying to stand apart from or against
    them. In narcissistic thinking, good is  to be identical. Infallibility is
    contradicted if their child takes another  path. They would attack you
    because in their desperate self-centeredness, they  misunderstood your
    motives.
</p>
<p>
    Emerging from this imbroglio,  you perceive an undesired response from them
    as deliberate. Your parents were  sarcastic and enraged and much that they
    did turned into an attack. This is how  you saw them. To expect harm and to
    see attack gets your running legs going,  which sets you up for less
    disappointment. You grow and still react to people  as hurtful. Freedom
    comes from not seeing malicious intention where none is  intended.
</p>
<p>
    Hold back on concluding the  presence of malicious intent. Doubt your
    supposition and, before you draw a  conclusion, find out the facts
    <a name="page256"></a>of motivation. Use outside  information and underplay
    your predilection for injury.
</p>
<p>
    We are afraid of change and  repeat behaviors that wreck our lives. Sameness
    to sameness. If we try to  change, we do so at a snail’s pace that never
    arrives or move so hurriedly that  little change occurs. Lightning speed
    protects us from being snared, cornered,  and hurt. We are afraid to hear
    the cry of what was left behind, an expectation  from our hypersensitive
    parents who overreacted to our changes. We learn from  this that all we do
    is hurtful, even a new hairdo or a way of speaking. We  worry more if we are
    changing a known habit. Will we lose our friends? We look  for and find
    responses of pain. We hurry past our feelings, so fraught with  anxiety,
    guilt, and grief.
</p>
<p>
    In change, there is losing  and gaining. We need to mourn our losses and to
    grow from the rotting wood of  renounced ways. The additional pain we feel
    is what we inflict on ourselves in  anticipation of the critical reactions
    from our parent stand-in.
</p>
<p>
    A woman wants to change but  says she can’t. She claims to like what she is
    doing, eating and smoking  herself to the grave. She thinks that her
    self-destructive behavior started as  rebellion against her narcissistic and
    controlling mother. She had to do it her  own way. Her mother lectured in
    scorn to those who could not learn. It seemed  like a giving but was really
    a taking. Daughter’s self-destructiveness gives  Mother a project to work
    on. She served her mother as an untoward kid and does  so now in gorging
    food and cigarettes. Her belly hurts from overeating and her  obesity hangs
    down. Does she know when her stomach is full? She never listens  to her
    feelings.
</p>
<p>
    With controlling parents who  need to be right and in charge, we do not
    learn what we need. Whether to stay  or go, to change or to stay put. We
    leave home as frightened fugitives, beset  by our negative introjects. We
    need to hear from our selves. That is the moose,  the beast that entered my
    vision and showed me a form of down-to-earth being.  That moose is an image
    of my inner self. It is my truth for me.
</p>
<p>
    Do not be surprised if stress  activates the voice of your negative
    introject. The child of a narcissist  falsely attaches her sense of
    self-worth to outcome, which creates desperate  worry. If your introject
    says worry, send it packing with questions like,  “What’s the big deal?”
    “Are you personalizing the outcome?” “Are you measuring  yourself with
    <a name="page257"></a>dollar bills?” Money does not imply value. Do  not
    apply external measurement to your self.
</p>
<p>
    Do not leap through  externally designated hoops. A scientist had to make
    A’s for his punitive and  narcissistic mother. Anything less led to a
    beating. As an adult, he suffers  from severe depressions and cannot work.
    In his mind his mother is at his  buttocks with a whip. He needs to remind
    himself that he likes to work and need  not seek outside approval for doing
    it. Put the introject in mothballs.
</p>
<p>
    We need to know when therapy  would be a good approach. Many people who
    suffer from an overwhelming and  intrusive negative introject are told,
    “It’s impossible to like yourself  better.” They have to live in misery as
    if it were the only way. Their  introject says “Follow me” to repetitive
    misery.
</p>
<p>
    A narcissistic falsehood is  to believe that one should appear perfect and
    need no help. Narcissistic  parents said that you should be able to master
    all problems, while finding you  incapable of adaptation. This attitude
    overlooks the fact that useful efforts  are stymied by aspects of your
    personality.
</p>
<p>
    You may see only your best  and call it perfect, or see only your worst and
    feel hopeless. You have been  parent-trained to look this way to please
    them. You may be unreachable to  contradictory comment. How are you to find
    your blind spots and errors if your  introject makes it too miserable to
    approach your self and your personality  disregards you self’s comments as a
    problem.
</p>
<p>
    Given such obstacles,  reasonable input is called for. Solitude is not
    efficient in getting the job  accomplished. Some of the most original
    people, scientists, artists, etc., have  asked for help. They questioned
    knowledge and openly showed their confusion and  error. They had little
    shame about blind spots and shortcomings since they  already respected their
    selves. By exposing weakness they got more strength.  They learned what they
    wanted to know. We do not advance by focusing on our  image. We want to
    change from a self-hater who refuses help and exposure to a  self-lover who
    accepts errors and openly works on difficulties.
</p>
<p>
    How do you know if you need  outside help? Are many people saying the same
    thing to you about you? Is their  tone exasperated and
    <a name="page258">
    </a>
    do their comments show that they think  you are not getting their message?
    Do you think that you are treated differently  from others? Is something
    wrong with your interactions but you cannot say what?  Outside help is in
    the offing.
</p>
<p>
    Childhood with narcissistic  parents means being overly subjected to
    criticism, which sensitized you to your  shortcomings. Are your faults as
    bad as your parents called them? What should  you do with outside criticism?
    A nonnarcissistic attitude is appropriate. You  can benefit from a group
    that works together on what is happening and what is  perceived.
</p>
<p>
    We were raised to think that  narcissistic people like our parents were the
    best people and that  nonnarcissists didn’t count for much. Getting to know
    nonnarcissists shows that  this is wrong. Children of narcissists can share
    their stories and speak about  their negative introjects. They share their
    troubles and move on.
</p>
<p>
    We need to investigate  opinions and hunches. Do not accept ideas at face
    value. Your narcissistic  parents raised you to swallow the family line.
    Mom/Dad was “correct” in  viewpoint and “perfect” in parenting. Now you are
    easily misled by forceful  sellers. Focus on your habit of acceptance. Know
    that you will bend under  pressure. Inquire about the facts and take the
    time you need before making a  decision. Do not renounce what you want just
    to please another. In searching  for friends, give up codependency. Wait for
    one that you like and hunt for one  that you trust, a person who accepts you
    as you are.

<p>
    Because children of narcissists are raised to follow parental dictates,  to
    believe that what the parent thinks is right and to defer to authority, it
    is important for these individuals to break the habit of allowing other
    people  to set their path.
</p>
<p>
    For this reason, it is  inappropriate for me to recommend a course of
    action. This book has presented  many kinds of examples and methods to get
    you closer to your true identity.  There are various techniques of
    meditation and a large variety of therapy  workshops or individual therapies
    in which you can work to change yourself. If you  do not know which one to
    choose, attend various workshops and test them out.  Read books on the
    subject. Speak to people and hear what they think about the  method they
    follow.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="page261"></a>As with  all of life’s experience, you must be the
    judge of its worth. What someone else  values and what you hold dear may
    differ. The main thing is to accept what you  have tested and personally
    found true. Membership in a group can be comforting  but not as comforting
    as learning to stand alone.

</h1>
<p>
    <a name="page7"></a>Thanks to close friends,  especially Lisa, Erwin, and
    Art, who helped me surmount my doubts when writing  this book. Great
    appreciation to Harold Brody, the psychoanalyst who supported  my struggle
    for self-definition and said in response to my questioning his  words, “Life
    is too short for lying.” Truthful words stay with you.
</p>
<p>
    I appreciate those who  trained me in psychotherapy, especially in observing
    the effects of insight.  Thanks to Bernard Kalinkowitz, director of the
    N.Y.U. program in Clinical  Psychology. It was he and the program that
    welcomed me to psychology.
</p>
<p>
    Gratitude to all who told  their stories. To Regula Noetzli, a literary
    agent who put great effort and  insight into showing me what was readable
    and then into getting it published.  Thanks to Maria Guarnaschelli, senior
    editor at William Morrow, who understood  the book and wholeheartedly
    supported it.

</p>
<p>
    Advance  praise for Trapped in the Mirror: <br/>
    Adult Children of Narcissists in Their Struggle for Self
</p>
<p>
    Elan Golomb, Ph.D.
</p>
<p>
    “Dr. Golomb’s direct and personal style and  clear writing will make this
    book a valuable resource for all who have suffered  the effects of being
    raised in predominantly narcissistic families. This book  will also be
    useful to new therapists and analysts who want clarification in
    understanding narcissism.”
</p>
<p>
    –JOANN GERARDI, PH.D. <br/>
    President, American Institute of Psychoanalysis
</p>
<p>
    “Dr. Golomb presents a unique perspective on the  dynamics of narcissism and
    writes in a compassionate and sensitive manner that  underscores the pain
    and turmoil of those afflicted, never trivializing or  oversimplifying their
    problems. Trapped in  r/jeA/fjrrorwillbe of interest both to lay readers and
    people suffering from  narcissistic disorders, and will also offer insights
    to all professionals.”
</p>
<p>
    –HERBERT ROBBINS, PH.D. <br/>
    President, New York Society of Clinical Psychologists
</p>
<p>
    “The works of Kohut, Kernberg, Klein, and  Winnicott show their faces in Dr.
    Golomb’s understanding of her patients’  dilemmas, and the reader is the
    beneficiary of her many years of analytic and  life experiences. Trapped in
    the Mirror will help  patients who are ready to tolerate the feelings of
    loss and rage that accompany  the process of deidealizing such a parent.”
</p>
<p>
    –DONALD  MORGAN, PH.D.
</p>
<p>
    “Dr. Golomb’s book addresses a new and important  area – patterns of
    narcissistic relationships. By using her own experience as a  bridge, Dr.
    Golomb presents a clear picture of the damaging family dynamics we  too
    often see in our work with adolescents and their parents.”
</p>
<p>
    –MARTIN A. BUCCOLO, PH.D. <br/>
    Chief, Adolescent Division Four Winds Hospital, Katonah, New York
