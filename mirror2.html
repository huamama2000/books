France should feel satisfied. Marie Antoinette offered her own narcissistic

The introject embodies the demands the child is supposed to meet in order to
gain parental approval. We have seen strong examples of this negative intro=

failing to meet his standards, as when John grew utterly depressed for not

can never be fully integrated into the personality as a normal conscience. =

leads a person like John to make a suicidal gesture for doing poorly at sch=
